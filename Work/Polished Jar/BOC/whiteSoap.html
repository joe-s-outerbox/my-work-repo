                        <li><strong>Choose a Font:</strong> We offer various font styles, from elegant scripts to modern <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/sans_serif" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">sans serif typefaces</a> so you can craft a personal message or monogram.

                <h3>What Types of Soap Can I Use?</h3>
                <p>

                <h3>How Do I Clean My Soap Dispenser?</h3>
                <p>
                    To maintain the pristine condition of your white soap dispenser, we recommend gently wiping the surface with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid applying abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, which can damage the finish and artwork on your custom labels. Regular cleaning helps preserve its visual appeal and functionality.

                <h3>How Often Should I Refill My Dispenser?</h3>
                <p>
                    For best performance, it's advisable to refill your dispenser when it reaches about two-thirds empty. This helps prevent the pump from drying out and ensures a consistent flow of soap. Regular refills keep your dispenser functioning smoothly and efficiently, providing a reliable experience.
