    <h3>Do I need to perform any maintenance on refillable soap dispensers?</h3>
    <p><strong>Most of our containers are very low maintenance. We recommend washing them by hand instead of using the dishwasher.</strong> Simply wiping the outside clean is usually enough to keep them looking great. You can use a toothpick or pin to remove any buildup and rinse with warm water if you need to clean the pumps.</p>
