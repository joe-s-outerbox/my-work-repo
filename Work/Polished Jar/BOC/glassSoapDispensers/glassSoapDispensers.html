            <p>When it comes to our glass soap dispensers, we understand you might have some questions. These answers will help. </p>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>How Do I Maintain My Glass Soap Dispenser?</h3>
                <p>Maintaining your glass soap dispenser is straightforward. Regularly wipe the dispenser's exterior with mild soap and a soft, damp cloth to maintain its pristine appearance. For a deeper clean, especially to remove soap residue from inside the bottle, fill it with warm water and a small amount of mild detergent, shake gently, and rinse thoroughly. Avoid using abrasive pads or cleaners that may scratch the glass. With proper care, your dispenser will retain its clarity and functionality for years.</p>
