                <h3>What is the easiest way to refill reusable soap dispensers without making a mess?</h3>
                <p>
                    Refilling can be somewhat challenging when you use thick shampoo and conditioner. <strong>The simplest solution is to use a washable and flexible funnel.</strong> A standard plastic or metal funnel keeps thin hand and dish soaps properly directed into the container during pouring.

                <h3>How do I choose soap dispensers for my rentals?</h3>
                <p>
                    Start by finding soap dispensers that match your rental property’s overall design. <strong>We advise people to look for high-quality materials and designs that are simple to clean and maintain.</strong> Durability is also a factor since <a href="https://safely.com/articles/vacation-rental-wear-and-tear/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">vacation rental items can take a lot of abuse</a>.

                <h3>Do I need to perform any maintenance on refillable soap dispensers?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Most of our containers are very low maintenance. We recommend washing them by hand instead of using the dishwasher.</strong> Simply wiping the outside clean is usually enough to keep them looking great. You can use a toothpick or pin to remove any buildup and rinse with warm water if you need to clean the pumps.
