        <h2>The Freight Industry</h2>
		<p>The freight industry in North America is massive and continues to grow.<em> According to the American Trucking Association, the industry generated $791.7 billion in revenue in 2019, and trucking accounted for 72.5% of all freight transported in the United States.</em> The industry also employs over 7.7 million people, making it a significant contributor to the North American economy.</p>
		<p><strong>The freight industry includes several types of freight carriers, including flatbed trucking companies, railroads, air freight carriers and ocean freight carriers.</strong> LTL trucking companies are the most commonly used for smaller cargo that doesn't take up more than 12' of trailer space, while independent trucking companies are preferred for partial truckload and full truckload freight.</p>
		<h2>Types of Trucking Trailers Used to Transport Freight</h2>
		<p>Freight trucking companies use a variety of trucking trailer types to transport different types of cargo. Here are some of the most common types of trucking trailers we use to transport your freight at Freight Rate Central.</p>
		<h3>1. Flatbed Trailers</h3>
		<p><a href="https://freightratecentral.com/trucking-companies/flatbed-trailers-truckload-rates/">Flatbed trailers</a> are open trailers that don't have a roof or walls. They are ideal for transporting oversized or irregularly shaped cargo like construction materials, heavy machinery and vehicles. <em>Flatbed trailers come in various sizes, ranging from 48 to 53 feet in length, and can be loaded from the top, sides or rear.</em> This versatility makes flatbed trailers a popular choice for freight that requires a lot of space or needs to be loaded and unloaded quickly.</p>
		<h3>2. Dry Van Trailers</h3>
		<p><a href="https://freightratecentral.com/trucking-companies/dry-van-enclosed-trailers-truckload-rates/">Dry van trailers</a> are the most common trailers used by freight trucking companies. These enclosed trailers make them ideal for transporting dry goods like food, clothing and electronics.<em> Dry van trailers come in various sizes, ranging from 28 to 53 feet in length.</em> They are also equipped with cargo straps and load bars to keep the cargo in place during transport.</p>
		<h3>3. Refrigerated Trailers</h3>
		<p><a href="https://freightratecentral.com/trucking-companies/refrigerated-trailers-reefers-truckload-rates/">Refrigerated trailers</a>, or reefers, are similar to dry van trailers. However, they have a refrigeration system to keep the cargo cool. Reefers are commonly used to transport perishable items like produce, meat and dairy products. These trailers are insulated and have temperature control settings that can be adjusted to maintain the proper temperature for the cargo. <em>Reefers come in various sizes, ranging from 28 to 53 feet in length.</em></p>
		<h3>4. RGN Trailers</h3>
		<p><a href="https://freightratecentral.com/trucking-companies/removable-gooseneck-rgn-truckload-rates/">RGN (removable gooseneck)</a> trailers are designed to transport heavy and oversized cargo like construction equipment and machinery. These trailers have a detachable front end that allows the cargo to be driven onto the trailer. The front end is then reattached to secure the cargo for transport. <em>RGN trailers are available in different sizes and weight capacities to accommodate various types of cargo.</em></p>
		<h3>5. Lowboy Trailers</h3>
		<p><a href="https://freightratecentral.com/trucking-companies/lowboy-trailer-truckload-rates/">Lowboy trailers</a> are similar to RGN trailers and are used to transport oversized and heavy cargo. These trailers have a low deck height, which allows them to transport cargo with a higher clearance. <em>Lowboy trailers come in different sizes and weight capacities, ranging from 35 to 65 tons.</em></p>
		<h3>6. Conestoga Trailers</h3>
		<p><a href="https://freightratecentral.com/trucking-companies/conestoga-trailers-truckload-rates/">Conestoga trailers</a>, also known as rolling tarp systems, are a type of flatbed trailer equipped with a tarp system that can be easily rolled open or closed. The tarp system consists of a tarp attached to the top of the trailer and a set of rails running down the sides of the trailer. The tarp can be rolled open or closed by sliding it along the rails, providing easy access to the cargo. This makes Conestoga trailers ideal for transporting cargo that needs to be protected from the elements, such as lumber, steel and machinery.</p>
		<p>The Conestoga trailer system is easy to operate and provides several advantages over traditional flatbed trailers. The tarp system eliminates the need for drivers to climb onto the trailer to secure the cargo with tarps, which reduces the risk of injuries and accidents and eliminates the time needed to tarp and secure the freight onto the trailer. <em>Conestoga trailers come in various sizes, ranging from 48 to 53 feet in length.</em></p>
