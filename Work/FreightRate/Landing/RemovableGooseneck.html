        <h2>Removable Gooseneck Trailers: Typical Variations</h2>
		<p>Freight Rate Centrals understands the ins and outs of shipping oversized RGN loads. That's why we offer a wide range of removable gooseneck trailers to meet your exact shipping requirements.</p>
        <p>When it comes to removable gooseneck trailers, there are three essential components: the gooseneck, which connects the trailer to the truck cab, the drop deck and the step back up over the rear axles of the trailer.<strong> Removable gooseneck trailers have a detachable front that can be dropped to the ground, providing a ramp for easy loading of oversized freight.</strong> This unique feature also means that RGN trailers drop in the middle, providing extra height for your cargo. This can be a game-changer in complying with the rules and regulations associated with heavy equipment transport in different countries, provinces or states.</p>
		<p>Moreover, RGN transport offers an extended trailer option where the drop-deck area can be extended up to 61ft, increasing the maximum RGN trailer length to 74ft. This allows for much larger usable space, making RGN trucking an excellent choice for transporting oversized equipment. With RGN freight trucking from Freight Rate Central, you can confidently transport even the most oversized loads.</p>

		<h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Different Types of RGN Loads</h3>
        <p>If you're looking to transport specialized machinery that's not rated for highway driving, RGN trailers are an excellent choice. Agricultural and farm machinery, off-road trucks, specialized mining equipment and various types of construction equipment can all benefit from RGN transport services.<em> No matter the vehicle, RGN freight trucking can transport it safely and effectively.</em></p>
