                    <h3 class="accordion">How Long Does LED Low Bay Lighting Last?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>LED low bay lighting has a significantly longer lifespan than traditional lighting sources. On average, low bay light fixtures can last 50,000 to 100,000 hours, depending on the quality of the fixture and the manufacturer. This longevity reduces the frequency of replacement and maintenance, resulting in cost savings over time.</p>

                    <h3 class="accordion">Do I Need High Bay or Low Bay Lighting?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The choice between high bay and low bay lighting depends on the height of the ceiling in your space:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>High Bay Lighting:</strong> Best for ceilings <strong>20 feet or higher</strong>, such as warehouses, factories, gymnasiums, or large retail stores. High bay lights provide powerful illumination with a wide, focused beam to ensure adequate light reaches the floor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Low Bay Lighting:</strong> Ideal for ceilings <strong>20 feet or lower</strong>, such as in garages, workshops, or smaller retail spaces. Low bay lights have a diffused beam spread, making them suitable for shorter distances.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Consider the ceiling height, the size of the area, and the required brightness when making your decision.</p>

                    <h3 class="accordion">Are Low Bay LED Fixtures Easy to Install?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Low bay LED fixtures are generally easy to install. Available with various mounting options that allow for convenient installation on ceilings or suspension from chains or hooks.

                    <h3 class="accordion">What's the Difference Between LED Low Bay Lights and High Bay Lights?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Following are the key distinctions between LED low bay lights and <a href="https://revolveled.com/collections/high-bay-ceiling-lights">high bay lights</a>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ceiling Height:</strong> LED low bay lights are designed for spaces with lower ceilings, typically up to 15 feet in height, while high bays are engineered for ceilings 15 feet or higher.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lumen Output:</strong> High bay lighting generally has a higher lumen output than low bay lighting to compensate for the greater distance between the fixture and the working plane. The higher lumen output ensures that the required light levels are maintained even at greater heights.</li>
                            <li><strong>Illumination Intensity:</strong> High bays produce high-intensity illumination to properly light up large spaces with high ceilings, ensuring sufficient visibility for tasks and activities. Low bays provide focused illumination for areas with lower ceilings, offering adequate lighting levels for specific workstations or retail displays.</li>
                        </ul>
