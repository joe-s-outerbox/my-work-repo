                    <h3 class="accordion">What Are Flat Panel LED Lights?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Flat panel LED lights are a type of lighting fixture designed for use in office buildings and other professional applications. The lightweight panels fit into ceiling grids to light businesses, classrooms, hospitals and other facilities where bright, uniform illumination is required.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="accordion">How Long Do LED Ceiling Light Panels Last?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The lifespan of LED ceiling light panels depends on their quality and usage, but they can last up to 100,000 hours. This longevity significantly reduces the need for frequent replacements, saving both time and money.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="accordion">Do Flat LED Light Panels Require any Special Maintenance?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>No, flat LED lights require minimal maintenance. Their long lifespan and durability reduce the need for frequent lamp changes. However, it's always advisable to keep them free from dust and avoid contact with moisture to maintain their performance and longevity.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="accordion">Which LED Panel Ceiling Lights Are the Brightest?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The brightness of LED panel ceiling lights is determined by their wattage and lumen output. In general, a higher wattage and higher lumens count will result in a brighter light. The color temperature is not a direct indication of brightness. The CCT, or Kelvins, refers to the visual appearance of the light in terms of color. Typically ranging from 3000K to 5000K, the color temperature can produce a warmer, cozier feel at 4000K (best for residential spaces), while 5000K produces cooler, whiter light more akin to daylight (better suited for outdoor areas and workshops). When choosing a bright LED panel light, it's essential to consider not only the brightness but also the quality of the light and its suitability for the intended space. Some areas may benefit from softer, warmer light, while others require cooler light.</p>
