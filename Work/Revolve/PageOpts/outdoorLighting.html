                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>LED garage strip lights are typically long, narrow strips of LED lights designed to provide bright and even lighting across a wide area. In contrast, vapor-tight light fixtures are heavier-duty and designed to withstand harsher conditions. While both types of lighting can be effective in a garage setting, vapor-tight lighting may be more appropriate for garages that require fixtures with higher levels of durability.</p>
