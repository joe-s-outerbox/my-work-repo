                    <h2>Types of Garage Light Fixtures</h2>
                    <p>Whether you're constructing a new parking garage or creating a lighting plan, there are several types of garage light fixtures that you can install to get the coverage you need. Following are the different kinds of LED garage lighting:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><a href="/collections/canopy-lights">LED Canopy Lights</a>:</strong> Rugged, reliable, and efficient, LED canopy garage light fixtures may be wall-mounted or installed on any flat surface to provide even light distribution. They feature weatherproof sealed diecast construction, making them suitable for outdoor applications where exposure to water is possible. Optional features include motion sensors, photocells, and emergency batteries.</li>
                        <li><strong><a href="/collections/strip-lights">LED Garage Strip Lights</a>:</strong> Our commercial LED garage strip lights provide value and quality in a traditional-style fixture that uses modern LED lamps for optimal energy efficiency. They are typically installed on indoor ceilings and can be used in new construction or retrofitted to replace outdated fluorescent lights. Polycarbonate reflectors supply uniform illumination. </li>
                        <li><strong>LED Vapor-Tight Fixtures:</strong> LED vapor-tight fixtures are ideal for parking garages routinely exposed to dirt, dust, and moisture. These LED lights for garage fixtures can be ceiling-mounted and are sealed and gasketed to maintain the best light quality. Optional lighting controls are available.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Bay LED Lights:</strong>  Low-bay LED garage lighting fixtures are viable because most parking garages have a ceiling less than 15 feet high. <a href="/collections/low-bay-led-lights">Low bay lights</a> are mounted on the ceiling, providing uniform illumination for commercial parking garages.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="obx-faq-contact"><p>The following are answers to some of the commonly asked questions about LED garage lights. Please let us know if you need more information on this or any lighting topic.</p></div>

                    <h3 class="accordion">What's the Difference Between LED Garage Strip Lights and Vapor-Tight Light Fixtures?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>LED garage strip lights are typically long, narrow strips of LED lights designed for indoor use and to provide bright and even lighting across a wide area. In contrast, <a href="/collections/vapor-tight">vapor-tight light fixtures</a> are heavier-duty and designed to withstand harsh, outdoor conditions. While both types of lighting can be effective in a garage setting, vapor-tight lighting is more appropriate for outdoor garages or other spaces subjected to more humidity/moisture.</p>

                    <h3 class="accordion">What Makes LED Garage Lights Better Than Other Lighting Solutions?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Here are the major advantages that LED garage lights have over other types of light fixtures:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> LED parking garage lights use significantly less energy than old-style incandescent bulbs and can reduce energy consumption by up to 80%. This saves money on energy bills while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Long Lifespan:</strong> LED lights last up to 50,000 hours or more, requiring less frequent replacement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Durability:</strong> LED lights are highly durable and resistant to shock, vibration and temperature changes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Instant On:</strong> Unlike traditional bulbs that take time to warm up, LED lights turn on instantly and provide full brightness immediately.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="accordion">How Many LED Lights Do I Need For My Garage?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The number of LED garage lights needed will depend on the size of your space, the ceiling height, and the desired level of brightness. You will need lights that can provide the <a href="/blogs/shop-talk/a-guide-to-footcandles">proper amount of footcandles for your space</a>, and the average footcandles needed is dependent on your application type.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="accordion">Is LED Garage Lighting Easy to Install?</h3>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Yes, most LED garage lighting is designed to be installed easily. LED garage strip lights can be mounted directly onto the ceiling or suspended by a hanging chain. LED tube lights can be installed in existing garage light fixtures, using a retrofit kit if necessary. LED high bay lights may require professional installation, but many models come with instructions and hardware to make the process easier.</p>
