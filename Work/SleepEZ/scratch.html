                    <p>Buying a mattress online has become a widely-accepted way to purchase the perfect one. But why
                        buy a mattress online? Thanks to generous return policies, there can be less risk in buying a
                        mattress online than buying one off a showroom floor where sales can often be “final.” But
                        figuring out what brands to trust can be tricky. Anyone can create a pretty website and make you
                        think they sell the best product, so it’s up to you to do your research first.</p>
                    <p>So should you buy a mattress online? Yes, you should! However, there are important things to keep
                        in mind when doing this.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Find out how long the mattress company has been in business. If they are a brand-new
                            company, you must ask yourself – will they be around in 5 years if I have a warranty issue?
                            Internet-only brands come and go literally at the click of a button. Make sure you’re buying
                            from someone you believe will be able to support you down the road.</li>
                        <li>Can you get someone on the phone? If not, this should be a major red flag. If you can’t
                            reach them when trying to give them your money, how do you expect to reach them when you
                            want to return it via a return? We’ve grown accustomed to non-personal transactions, and
                            this works well for many items. But talking to an actual human can make all the difference
                            in your mattress selection when you’re investing in something as important as your mattress
                            – where you’ll be spending up to 1/3 of your life.</li>
                        <li>In doing research, did you find that your company is on almost all of the review sites – and
                            they aren’t the biggest company out there? They are likely paying to be positively reviewed.
                            Only trust reviews from 3rd-party review platforms that limit reviews to people who have
                            purchased. We use a company called YotPo for this. Amazon is cracking down on fake reviews –
                            that should tell you something.</li>
