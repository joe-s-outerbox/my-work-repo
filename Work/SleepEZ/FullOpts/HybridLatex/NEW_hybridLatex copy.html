                Unlike the standard hybrid mattress, the 360 hybrid mattress has a zipper that allows you to access the

                split the firmness to have a different firmness for each side of the mattress. The 360 hybrid has a top

                Anything solid and sturdy will work just fine. The only types of foundations you want to avoid are
                slatted foundations where the gaps are more than 3" apart or box springs (with actual springs in them)
                that are 8 years old or more. Latex foam is a naturally breathable, open celled product and a slatted
                foundation is not necessary for the mattress to sleep cool. A slatted foundation will enhance the
                breathability but certainly isn't necessary because the mattress will breath on all exposed sides. If
                you live in a very high humidity area, a slatted foundation will reduce the chances of getting mold on
                the mattress cover.

                Generally speaking, our organic and natural mattresses are highly customizable and highly adjustable for
                softness, firmness, back support, pressure relief, etc. We have a high success rate with our initial
                recommendations, so adjustments are usually unnecessary. The Roma and Hybrid mattresses are enclosed and
                quilted on both sides, with the option to flip for a different level of firmness. The Roma and Hybrids
                are ideal for people under 240 pounds, and the Hybrid is an excellent choice for people who prefer a
                springier feel and more edge support. For more firmness options in a latex and coil Hybrid, the 360
                Pillowtop Hybrid has a customizable top 3" of latex and a button-tufted cover for a plusher feel. For a

                If the word "Hybrid" that's stitched on the side of the mattress is upright then the softer side is
                facing up. If the word Hybrid is upside-down then the softer side is facing down.

                Yes, the mattress has some glue that helps keep the components in place. We use a non-toxic water-based
                glue that is GreenGuard certified against harmful chemicals and off-gassing.

                For proper support and longevity of the Hybrid, we recommend 230-240 lbs or under per sleeper. Please
                add this question and answer to the 360 Hybrid page, and you can take out the question “What type of
                foundation can I use with this mattress?” if you need to for space considerations.
