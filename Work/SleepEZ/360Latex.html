    wire to ensure a sleep surface that’s durable and consistent. The wire flexes, adapting to your body’s contours for
    unmatched comfort and minimizing disturbances if you're sharing the bed. We use an 8" base packed with up to 1188
    individual pocket coils.
</p>
<p>In this pillow-top hybrid mattress, each spring in the pocketed-coil system moves independently, making it a champ at
    molding to the shape of your body. It’s a game-changer for pressure relief, especially in areas like the back,
    shoulders, and hips.
