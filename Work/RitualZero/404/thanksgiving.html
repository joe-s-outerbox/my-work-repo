<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Halloween is easily one of the most popular holidays in the United States, many
        still consider Thanksgiving to be the proper kickoff to the holiday season. It’s not difficult to see why;
        opportunities to dress to the nines, eat delicious foods, and catch up with friends and family you haven’t seen
        all year are few and far between. Thanksgiving also presents </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">plenty
        </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of opportunities to drink; many jobs and employers often give
        employees time off leading up to and immediately after Thanksgiving, which gives folks a chance to let loose and
        enjoy themselves. In fact, many have come to call the Wednesday before Thanksgiving Black Wednesday (or
    </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout_Wednesday"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackout
            Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) as many enjoy time in hometown bars catching up with
        old friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there are plenty of reasons to moderate your drinking during Thanksgiving
        weekend. And just because you aren’t drinking, or are drinking more mindfully doesn’t mean you can’t still enjoy
        some seriously tasty cocktails!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we’ll break down some reasons why it’s okay (and even better) to not
        consume alcohol in such large quantities, as well as some great drinks you can make that will be a hit with the
        whole family!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Why it’s okay to stay sober (or sober-ish) over Thanksgiving&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of reasons why it’s a good call to either stay sober or at the
        very least not drink </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">quite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">
        so much over Thanksgiving weekend. Many of these reasons are practical in nature; you’ll save some money,
        definitely save some calories, and manage to keep a cooler head when your uncle starts talking politics over
        dinner.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there are a number of more significant reasons, including:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safety - Every year, stories </span><a
            href="https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/thanksgiving-weekend-one-most-dangerous-periods-of-year-for-driving/509-50d29eb5-0986-45bc-b5a5-64a2165b589d"><span
                style="font-weight: 400;">like this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> serve as an
            unfortunate reminder of just how many people drink and drive, including driving with a buzz. Staying sober
            means you’ll be infinitely safer on the road and you’ll reduce your chances of getting a DUI.&nbsp;</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health - Alcohol has </span><a
            href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000886.htm"><span
                style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of calories per drink
            before sweeteners, mixers, or garnishes come into the mix. Save the calories for some extra turkey this
            year.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress/Anxiety - </span><a
            href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hangover-anxiety"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hangover
                anxiety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a very real thing, and emotions can run high when
            booze is involved. Save yourself some major Sunday Blues or Sunday Scaries by staying sober this
            Thanksgiving. Speaking of hangovers…</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear mind - You only get to see your family and
            hometown friends a few times a year. Cherish the weekend with them instead of spending your time hungover on
            the couch enjoying a Thanksgiving dinner of ibuprofen.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So what do I drink if I’m not drinking booze?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No worries. Just because you might not be drinking (or at least drinking as much)
        this Thanksgiving doesn’t mean you’ll have to miss out on all the fun. </span><a
