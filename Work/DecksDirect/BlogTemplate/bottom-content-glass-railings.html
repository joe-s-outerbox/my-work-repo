                    <p>We strongly recommend composite decking to anyone building or renovating a deck. A deck isn’t a short-term purchase. We hope you’ll be enjoying your deck for decades to come - and over the long-term, composite decking will save you a huge amount of time and money.</p>
                        <p>Wood decking (typically a pressure-treated pine) is prone to water damage, rot, staining, splintering and damage from insects like termites. Exposure to harsh weather will wear down wood deck boards, requiring you to regularly inspect and replace worn-out boards and restain existing boards.</p>
                        <p>Composite decking is surrounded by a strong, weather-resistant shell that prevents rotting, splintering, staining, and damage from insects or water. Composite’s durability also means your deck will last longer, and the composite boards will hold their original color better than wood, which fades badly in direct sunlight.</p>
                        <p>Wood needs to be stained regularly, adding a recurring cost (and a recurring chore) to your deck. Low-maintenance composite decking never needs staining. That’s why we recommend composite boards and carry a wide selection of the top brands available.</p>

            "text": "Composite deck boards will cost more than pressure-treated wood at the purchase, but composite decking ultimately costs less in the long run with lower maintenance costs and demands. Wood decking requires you to buy and apply deck stain regularly, locking you in to regular payments and work hours to maintain your deck. Composite decking is more durable, longer-lasting, and never needs to be stained - not even once. We’ve done the math, and it doesn’t take long for the recurring costs of wood decking to balloon well past the original cost of composite decking."

Composite decking will have a more authentic wood feel and won’t expand or contract as much with temperature changes. It also provides slightly better traction underfoot to prevent slips. PVC decking is even more resistant to mold and mildew than composite boards. That makes PVC a great option near lakes, pools, or oceans, where water exposure can wear on decking faster. PVC decking is also lighter-weight and doesn’t retain as much heat - while it can still get hot in the sun, it’ll cool down much faster than composite."

Wood-plastic composite is traditional composite material made of wood fibers and recycled plastic. Mineral-based composite (sometimes called MBC) is an enhanced version of PVC decking made from the highest-quality materials. Mineral-based composite boards have even less thermal expansion and contraction than PVC boards. They’re also typically thinner and lighter than composite boards, because at just 7/8 of an inch, an MBC board can deliver the same strength as a one-inch-thick composite board."

You could use hidden deck fasteners, which fit in between your boards and securely fasten boards to your deck frame. Keep in mind that if you use hidden fasteners, you’ll want to buy grooved-edge deck boards. The second option is to use deck board plug systems. With decking plugs, you sink screws through the top of your deck boards and fit a plug on top of the screwhead to fill the hole. We carry plugs made from the same exact material as most decking brands and finishes, so your plugs will exactly match the color and texture of your deck boards."
