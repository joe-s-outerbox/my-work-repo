              "faq_question": "What’s the difference between a snow plow and a snow pusher?",
              "faq_answer": "Skid steer snow pushers and skid steer snow plow attachments are both used to clear snow, but each one serves a different purpose. A snowplow is a blade attachment that can be angled to push snow to the side for clearing roads, driveways, and other areas. A snow pusher, on the other hand, is a box-like attachment that pushes snow straight ahead and is better for moving large amounts of snow efficiently in open areas like parking lots."
            },
            {
              "faq_question": "Do I need a skid steer snow plow attachment or a snow pusher attachment?",
              "faq_answer": "It depends on the type of area you need to clear. A snowplow is better for areas where snow needs to be moved to the side or into piles, while a snow pusher is better for moving large volumes of snow straight ahead in open spaces."
            },
            {
              "faq_question": "What size skid steer snow plow or pusher do I need?",
              "faq_answer": "The size of the snowplow or pusher you’ll need depends on the width of the area you’ll be clearing and your skid steer’s power and lifting capacity. A wider plow or pusher can clear more snow in one pass but requires more power to operate."
            },
            {
              "faq_question": "Is a snow plow or snow pusher better for deep snow?",
              "faq_answer": "Both skid steer snow attachments can be used to push deep snow, but a snow pusher is more effective at moving large volumes of snow quickly and efficiently."
            },
            {
              "faq_question": "What should I look for when shopping for skid steer snow blades?",
              "faq_answer": "One thing you’ll want to consider is the angling capability of your skid steer snow blades, which can allow you to more easily direct snow to where you want it to go. If you want to direct the snow from the comfort of your cab, you’ll also want to consider snow blades with hydraulic control. And lastly, consider snowplows and snow pushers with a floating blade that can move up and down independently of your skid steer, which helps the blade follow the contour of uneven ground."
