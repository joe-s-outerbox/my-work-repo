              "faq_answer": "First, align your implement so the lower arms and upper link align with the attachment points on the implement, then lower the hitch arms to connect with the implement’s lower pins. Secure the implement with the upper link and ensure that all connections are tight and aligned correctly. Once you adjust the hitch arms and link to achieve your desired working height and angle, your hitch is ready for use."

The type of 3 point attachments you’ll need will depend on the type of mounting system your tractor and 3 point hitch has."

              "faq_question": "How do I choose the right three point hitch attachments for my tractor?",

The capacity of the 3 point hitch attachments you choose must also match your tractor’s power and lifting ability. Lastly, your 3 point hitch attachments should be able to perform the types of jobs you’ll be using it for."
