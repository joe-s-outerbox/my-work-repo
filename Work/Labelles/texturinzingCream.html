        <h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
        <ul class="desktop-columns" style="column-count: 2;">
            <li><strong>Coconut Oil -</strong> Coconut Oil is absorbed into your hair very quickly! This provides moisture and conditions the hair. That helps tame frizz and prevent your hair from getting dry and breaking off. This also helps with dandruff, dry and itchy skin, promoting healthy and happy hair growth!</li>
            <li><strong>Shea Butter -</strong> Full of fatty acids and vitamins, Shea Butter will help hydrate your hair while also locking in moisture. Its soothing properties help combat frizz, making hair much more combalbe and manageable!</li>
            <li><strong>No Alcohol -</strong> Alcohol in hair products can cause your hair to become dry, brittle, and break off. It is drying out your skin, leading to itchy, flaky, and irritated skin. This prevents hair from growing back healthy and happy!</li>
            <li><strong>No Parabens -</strong> Parabens are in a lot of hair products. However many studies suggest that they can disrupt hormones in your body, increase the risk of cancer, affect birth outcomes, dry out your skin, and even cause hair loss. That’s why LaBelle’s ensures not to use them in our products!</li>
            <li><strong>No Sodium Chloride -</strong> Sodium chloride in hair products will dry your skin and strip away the natural oils, leading to unhealthy skin and hair loss. Nothing that you want or are looking for!</li>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Texturizing Cream</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the most common questions guys ask about LaBelle's texturizing cream, along with straightforward answers to help you get the best out of your hair care routine.</p>
        <h3>How Much Grooming Cream Should I Use for My Hair?</h3>
        <p>It depends on the look you're going for. If you want to rock that laid-back, just-rolled-out-of-bed look or a casual slick back, use a small amount, about the size of a dime. Add a little more grooming cream for a polished side part, comb it through and you've got a classic style that never fails to impress. Want a textured top? Work it in, spike it up or create waves, adding more if needed. It's all about finding the right balance for your hair type and style.
        </p>
        <h3>Can Short Hair Styling Products Be Used on Damp Hair?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely! Applying texturizing cream to slightly damp hair can help distribute the product evenly, giving you a more natural look.</p>
        <h3>How Long Does the Hold Last?</h3>
        <p>The hold is designed to last throughout the day, but it's easy to rework with a bit of water if you need to restyle. When you're ready to remove the grooming cream, a regular shampooing will do the trick. It washes out easily without leaving residue.</p>
