        <h2>Featured Highlights</h2>
        <ul class="desktop-columns" style="column-count: 2;">
            <li><strong>Coconut Oil -</strong> Coconut Oil is absorbed into your hair very quickly! This provides moisture and conditions the hair. That helps tame frizz and prevent your hair from getting dry and breaking off. This also helps with dandruff, dryness, and itchy skin, promoting healthy and happy hair growth!</li>
            <li><strong>Shea Butter -</strong> Full of fatty acids and vitamins, Shea Butter will help hydrate your hair while also locking in moisture. Its smoothing properties help combat frizz, making hair much more combalbe and manageable!</li>
            <li><strong>No Alcohol -</strong> Alcohol in hair products can cause your hair to become dry, brittle, and break off. Drying out your skin can lead to itchy, flaky, and irritated skin. This prevents hair from growing back healthy and happy!</li>
            <li><strong>No Parabens -</strong> Parabens are in a lot of hair products. However many studies suggest that they can disrupt hormones in your body, increase the risk of cancer, affect birth outcomes, dry out your skin, and even cause hair loss. That’s why LaBelle’s ensures not to use them in our products!</li>
            <li><strong>No Sodium Chloride -</strong> Sodium Chloride in hair products will dry your skin and strip away the natural oils, leading to unhealthy skin which then causes hair loss. Nothing that you want or are looking for!</li>
        </ul>
