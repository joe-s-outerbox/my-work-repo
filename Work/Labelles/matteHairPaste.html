        <ul class="desktop-columns" style="column-count: 2;">
            <li><strong>Beeswax -</strong> Rich in vitamin A! Beeswax helps lock in natural moisture without leaving a greasy residue, acting as a natural conditioner. Studies have found that Beeswax can enhance hair growth! It can help with itchy or irritated scalps and can help with dandruff. It also has antimicrobial properties!</li>
            <li><strong>Soy Protein -</strong> The amino acids that Soy Protein offer stimulate hair follicles and strengthen hair shafts. This promotes healthy hair growth! It can also help speed up hair growth and can help with thinning hair. </li>
            <li style="break-after: column;"><strong>No Alcohol -</strong> Alcohol in hair products can cause your hair to become dry, brittle and break off. Drying out your skin which can lead to itchy, flaky and irritated skin. This prevents hair from growing back healthy and happy!</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>No Parabens -</strong> Parabens are in a lot of hair products. However many studies suggest that they can disrupt hormones in your body, increase the risk of cancer, affect birth outcomes, dry out your skin and even cause hair loss. That’s why LaBelle’s makes sure not to use them in our products!</li>
            <li><strong>No Sodium Chloride -</strong> Sodium Chloride in hair products will dry your skin and strip away the natural oils leading to unhealthy skin, which then causes hair loss. Nothing that you want or are looking for!</li>
