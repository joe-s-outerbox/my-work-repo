<p><span><strong>Whether you're making one at home or sending it to MemoryStitch, here are some general guidelines for the best fabrics for t-shirt quilts!</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Making <a href="https://memorystitch.com/products/t-shirt-quilt">T-shirt quilts</a> is lots of fun, but sometimes the materials create lots of problems.  Below are our recommendations to create an awesome experience and the most snuggly quilt.</span></p>
<h2>Best Materials for T-Shirt Quilts</h2>
<p>Our focus is t-shirts, but you can use many other shirts and fabrics in your t-shirt quilts. Even with options such as <a href="https://memorystitch.com/products/double-sides-t-shirt-quilt">double-sided t-shirt quilts</a>, <a href="https://memorystitch.com/products/kids-t-shirt-quilts">kids t-shirt quilts</a>, and even <a href="https://memorystitch.com/products/onesie-quilt">onesie quilts</a>, that’s not all you’re limited to.</p>
<p>You can use polos, sweatshirts, scrubs, and jerseys! You can also use button down shirts and shirts with zippers -
    these can add a really interesting and unique look to your quilt! Other materials are fleece, flannel, polyester,
    and dri-fit materials.</p>
<p>You can use tank tops and v-necks too, but please note that these materials may require a little extra sewing if you have to back them to ensure they fit your desired panel size.</p>
<p>Want to include an item that isn't a shirt at all? You might still be able to use it! Measure the item to see if you
    can get enough material in a block for your desired panel size.</p>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Difficult Materials to Work With</h2>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <li>Canvas and Denim</li>
    <li>Down and Knitted Items</li>
    <li>Leather, Lycra, and Silk</li>
    <li>Letter Jackets</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're making something at home and feel confident about using these materials, give it a try! With the right needle and some patience, you might be able to get it to work.</p>
   <p>If you're sending your shirts off to MemoryStitch, please do not send in materials that are extremely difficult to work with. If you have an item not listed here, feel free to <a href="https://memorystitch.com/pages/contact-us">contact us</a> and ask! Maybe we haven't used it before, but we'd love to try it!</p>
