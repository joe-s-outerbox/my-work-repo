    <inline style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;">Linear actuators are found in thousands of
        different applications throughout the robotics industry. You might not see them but they're quietly performing
        key functions behind the scenes to help keep us productive and safe. From competition robots built by FTC and
        FRC students to robots for manufacturing, testing and simulation. All of that movement is driven by motors and
        actuators.<br style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both;"><br
            style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both;">Identifying the best robot actuator for use in your device is a
        challenge for product designers but can be critical to the success of your device. There are many options out
        there from vacuum to pneumatic and hydraulic actuators and they can get very expensive.<br
            style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both;">Actuonix Motion
        Devices has been working with some of the biggest names in manufacturing for years. Top companies choose to work
        with Actuonix because we are can produce high quality actuators for robotics at a fraction of the cost of other
        manufacturers. There is no other manufacturer out there who offers the vast selection of low-cost actuators that
        we do, and we are always developing more. In addition to our current product offering of more than 160 products,
        we have more than ten <a href="https://www.actuonix.com/Stepper-Motor-Actuators-s/1979.htm"

            models in development</a> that will be released in coming months.<br
            style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both;"><br style="box-sizing: inherit; clear: both;">With more models to
        choose from than anybody, we probably have a stock product that you can integrate into your device. Of course
        this won't work for everybody which is why we offer a custom robot actuator design service. We can make changes
        to our stock products to suit your specifications or design you a completely new device.*</inline>

    rapidly growing. The demand for small sizes and low costs can leave manufacturers looking for ways to save money in
    their designs. We recognize this need and have developed our product lines to cater to the robotics industry.
    Actuonix is your best bet for quality, inexpensive actuators for your robotic device.<br
