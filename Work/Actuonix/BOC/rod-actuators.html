                            linear motion.</strong> Similar to <a href="https://www.actuonix.com/track-actuators">track
                            actuators</a>, they consist of a rod or shaft that extends and retracts, driven by an
                        actuation mechanism such as an electric motor or hydraulic system. Rod actuators are widely used
                        in various industries to achieve precise positioning, movement, and force application in
                        automated systems.

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p class="mt-faq mb-0">Rod actuators work by converting rotational motion into linear motion. They
                        typically consist of a motor, a gearbox (if applicable), and a lead screw or ball screw
                        mechanism. When the motor is activated, it rotates the screw, which is threaded through a nut
                        attached to a rod or shaft. As the screw turns, the nut moves along the threads, causing the rod
                        to extend or retract depending on the direction of rotation.</p>
