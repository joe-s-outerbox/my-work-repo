        <h2 class="mt-0">Choosing Your Limit Switch Actuator</h2>
        <p><strong>Actuonix S-series actuators have internal limit switches that will turn off power to the motor when the actuator reaches within 0.5mm of the end of stroke.</strong> A limit switch actuator is easily operated simply by reversing polarity. It can be used with a DPDT switch, relay, brushed reversible speed controller, the Actuonix Wireless Remote Control or our Timer Relay.</p>
        <p>Here's a rundown of the 5 categories of Actuonix S-series limit switch actuators to choose from.</p>
        
        <h3>PQ12-S Series Limit Switch Actuator</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.actuonix.com/pq12-s">PQ12-S</a> stands out as our most compact limit-switched actuator. It's truly remarkable in its micro size. With a 20mm <a href="https://www.wikihow.life/Measure-the-Stroke-in-Electric-Linear-Actuators" target="_blank">stroke</a> and three gear choices, it offers force capabilities between 2 and 10 pounds and is so tiny that it can fit inside a matchbox.</p>

        <h3>L12-S Series Limit Switch Actuator</h3>
        <p>Representing our standard lineup of limit-switched actuators, the <a href="/l12-s">L12-S</a> offers four distinct stroke lengths: 10mm, 30mm, 50mm and 100mm. Coupled with three gearing variations, it can exert forces ranging from 5 to 18 pounds.</p>

        <h3>L16-S Series Limit Switch Actuator</h3>
        <p>Meet the L12 series' more robust sibling. Thanks to its larger motor, the <a href="https://www.actuonix.com/l16-s">L16-S</a> can handle heftier loads and achieve faster speeds than its counterpart, the L12-S. It comes with three gearing variations and is available in three stroke lengths: 50mm, 100mm and 140mm, providing forces between 10 and 45 pounds.</p>

        <h3>P16-S Series Limit Switch Actuator</h3>
        <p>The <a href="/p16-s">P16-S</a> is distinguished by its planetary drive, making it ideal for tasks demanding greater forces and suited for high-duty cycle applications. It's available in four stroke dimensions: 50mm, 100mm, 150mm and 200mm — with three gearing options, capable of producing forces between 10 and 67 pounds.</p>
        
        <h3>T16-S Series Limit Switch Actuator</h3>
        <p>Presenting our innovative <a href="/track-actuators">track actuators</a> series, inspired by the well-received P16 line. The T16's track design is more compact than the P16 with different stroke options but the same stellar performance, as it employs a sliding mount instead of an extending shaft. This sliding mechanism notably enhances the maximum side load capacity. Choose from three stroke lengths — 100mm, 200mm and 300mm — and three gearing options to achieve forces ranging from 10 to 60 pounds.</p>

        <h2>Defining Limit Switch Actuators</h2>
        <p>Actuonix limit switch actuators detect when the actuator is fully extended or retracted and cut power to the motor. This ensures the actuator isn't damaged by continuing to drive the motor past the physical limits of the actuator. Once a limit switch is triggered, the actuator can still easily be driven back in the opposite direction by reversing the polarity of the power supply.</p>
