        <h2 class="mt-0">Compact Precision: PQ12 Linear Actuators</h2>
        <p><strong>Weighing in at just 15 grams, PQ12 linear actuators stand out for their remarkable compactness,
                offering precision movement in the most space-constrained applications.</strong> These actuators,
            notable for their minimalistic yet robust design, are the perfect fusion of size and accuracy, making PQ12
            series micro linear actuators ideal for a variety of industries. </p>
        <p class="mb-0">The affordably-priced PQ12 is a suitably powerful actuator for its size – which is why it's become a popular
            choice for OEM manufacturers as well as <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/hardware"
                target="_blank">Arduino</a> and <a href="https://traxxas.com/support/How-Do-I-Get-Started-RC"
                target="_blank">RC hobbyists</a>. It's available with end-of-stroke limit switches or linear feedback
            along the full length of stroke. In addition, the PQ12R is available as a plug-and-play replacement for RC
            servos. A complete closed-loop system can be realized with the addition of an LAC board. Our PQ12 Series
            micro linear actuators are compatible with accessories like <a

                <p class="mt-0 mb-0">With their sleek profile, PQ12 series micro linear actuators are a go-to solution
                    for projects demanding exact motion control without compromising on space. Each variant in the PQ12
                    Series Micro Linear Actuator lineup is engineered to excel in different scenarios, ensuring a
                    perfect match for your specific requirements. </p>

        ">PQ12-S Series</h3>
        <p>These units are operated by switching polarity on pins 2&amp;3 of the actuator's flat cable. The "S" series
            has end-of-stroke limit switches that will turn off the unit if it runs into its end stop. These can be run
            with a DPDT switch, relay or brushed DC motor controller. The PQ12-S is available in 6v or 12v varieties.
        </p>
        <h3>PQ12-P Series</h3>
        <p>The "P" series actuators feature an analog position feed&shy;back signal that can be input to an external
            controller. The "P" series can plug directly into our Linear Actuator Control Board (LAC) to give the "P"
            series the ability to be controlled with USB (via our Configuration Utility Software), 0-5V, 4-20mA, RC
            Servo or PWM. On board adjustment of speed, sensitivity and stroke limits are also available via the LAC.
            The PQ12-P is available in 6v or 12v. <em>Unlike the "S" series, the "P" does not have end-limit
                switches.</em></p>
        <h3>PQ12-R Series</h3>
        <p>The PQ12-R linear servo is a direct replacement for a standard rotary servo. It uses the same standard 3-wire
            connector, ground power and control. Regardless of how you drive your servos – be it with an RC receiver, an
            Arduino board or a VEX micro-controller – the PQ12-R servo will function in place of a standard rotary
            servo, with the added benefit of providing linear motion. <em>The "R" series is only available as a 6V
                unit.</em></p>
