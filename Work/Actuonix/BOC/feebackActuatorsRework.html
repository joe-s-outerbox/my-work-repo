        <h2 class="mt-0">The Best Selection of Linear Actuators With Feedback</h2>
        <p><strong>Actuonix P-series feedback actuators feature an internal potentiometer for position
                feedback.</strong> They are ideally suited to automatically controlled positioning systems, but they can
            also be driven manually. The P-series actuators have no built-in controller — they send an analog position
            feedback signal that can be input to an external controller. We devised our <a
                href="https://www.actuonix.com/lac">Linear Actuator Control (LAC) Board</a> to work with the feedback
            actuators in the P series.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">The P-series lineup can be used as a linear servo by connecting the actuator to an external controller such as the LAC board. This control board reads the position signal from the P-series feedback actuators, compares it with your input control signal, then commands the actuator to move via an onboard H-bridge circuit. The LAC allows any one of the following control inputs:<strong> 0-3.3VDC, 4-20mA, 0-5V PWM, 1-2ms standard RC servo or USB</strong>. The RC input effectively transforms your actuator into a linear servo, which is a direct replacement for any common hobby servo used in RC toys and robotics.</p>
