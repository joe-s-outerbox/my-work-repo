        <h2 class="mt-0">How Do 12V Actuators Work?</h2>
        <p>Let's take a closer look at how 12V linear actuators function:</p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
            <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> 12V actuators require a 12V power supply for operation. This voltage
                level is ideal for compatibility with many standard electrical systems in vehicles, consumer electronics
                and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Conversion of Energy:</strong> Inside each 12V actuator, there's an electric motor. This motor
                converts the electrical energy from the power source into mechanical energy. The type of motor and its
                specifications can vary based on the actuator's design and intended use.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission Mechanism:</strong> The rotational motion of the motor is converted into linear
                motion by a lead screw assembly. Many 12V linear actuators also utilize a gearbox mechanism that can be
                customized to adjust the force and speed characteristics of the actuator. </li>
            <li><strong>Control System:</strong> 12V linear actuators are equipped with a control system to regulate the
                motion. This system can vary from simple on/off <a
                    href="/control-boards-switches-potentiometers">actuator switches</a> to more complex setups,
                allowing for precise position control. </li>
            <li><strong>Output:</strong> The result is a controlled linear motion that can push or pull with varying
                degrees of force and speed, depending on the actuator's design and the application's requirements. </li>
        </ul>

                <p class="mt-0 mb-0"><strong>Our selection of 12V linear actuators is highly customizable, allowing you
                        to accurately tailor your linear motion solution no matter the project.</strong> When selecting
                    the ideal actuator for your project, understanding and considering factors like stroke length, gear
                    ratio, backdrive force and maximum load is crucial. Each attribute is pivotal in ensuring the
                    actuator meets and exceeds your project requirements.</p>

        <ul style="/* margin-bottom: 77px; */">
            <li><strong>Stroke Length:</strong> This refers to the extent of movement the actuator can achieve, from
                fully retracted to fully extended. Our 12V linear actuators are available in stroke lengths ranging from
                10mm to 300mm, enabling precise matching to the specific motion requirements of your application.
                Whether you need subtle movements for delicate operations or extensive reach for larger-scale tasks,
                there's an actuator designed for your needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Gear Ratio:</strong> The gear ratio in an actuator influences its speed and force. A higher gear
                ratio means more force but lower speed, and vice versa. This balance is crucial in applications where
                the movement speed is as critical as the force exerted. Actuonix's range of 12V actuators provides
                options with different gear ratios, allowing you to fine-tune the actuator's performance to your
                specific speed and force requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Backdrive Force:</strong> This is the force required to move the actuator when power is not
                applied. In applications where maintaining position is vital even when the actuator is not powered, a
                higher backdrive force is advantageous. Actuonix 12V actuators offer varying levels of backdrive force,
                ensuring you can select an actuator that maintains its position under different conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum Load:</strong> The maximum load capacity indicates the highest force or weight the
                actuator can handle before stalling. This is a critical factor for ensuring safety and functionality in
                your project. Actuonix's 12V linear actuators have varied load capacities, making them suitable for a
                wide range of tasks</li>
