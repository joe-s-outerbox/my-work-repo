<div><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;">T16 Linear Track Actuators</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;">Actuonix's Motion Devices is again pushing the limits of linear motion with our all-new T16 series linear track actuators. These devices use a mounting block that travels along a track rather than an extending rod; this means that the T16 can be used in projects with even tighter space restrictions than our standard actuators. By design, linear track actuators are also much more tolerant of side loads, thus making these ideal for projects where a side load is present.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;">Our T16 Mini Track Actuators are available in 3 stroke lengths: 100mm (3.9"), 200mm (7.9") and 300mm (11.8"), along with 3 gearing options: 22:1, 64:1 or 256:1. These combinations make the T16 mini track actuator versatile and ideal for a variety of applications.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;">With 256:1 gearing, the T16 boasts an impressive maximum force of 67lbs! With 22:1 gearing, the T16 can achieve a maximum speed of 46mm/s (1.8"/s).</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;">The T16 mini track actuator is offered with two different control options, allowing you to choose how you control your device.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;">T16 P-Series</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;">The T16-P series linear track actuators do not have a built in controller; they do however, provide an analog position feedback signal that can be input to an external controller. The “P” series can be used with our Linear Actuator Control Board (LAC) which gives you the option of controlling them with USB (via our Configuration Utility Software), 0-5v, 4-20mA, RC Servo or PWM. The LAC board also offers on-board adjustment of speed, end limits and sensitivity.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;">T16-S Series</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;">The T16-S series is operated by reversing polarity on the actuator's two leads. It comes with end of stroke limit switches that will shut the unit down if it runs into it's end stop. These can be run with a DPDT switch, relay or brushed DC motor controller. T16 series actuators come in 12V input only.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14pt;">All of our actuators come with a hardware kit for easy mounting.</span></div>
