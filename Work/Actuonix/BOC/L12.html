                <p class="mb-0">Customers can select from four distinct stroke lengths: 10mm (0.4 inches), 30mm (1.2 inches), 50mm (2 inches) and 100mm (3.9 inches). This variety ensures that our L12 linear actuators can be perfectly tailored to fit diverse application needs. In addition to stroke length, L12 actuators are available in three force and speed combinations, featuring 50:1, 100:1 or 210:1 gearing. This flexibility allows for accurate control over the motion and force, making sure that the L12 series micro linear actuators are highly adaptable to many tasks.</p>

"><em>L12 series actuators are available with four different control options:</em></p>
        <h3 class="mt-0">1. L12-I Series</h3>
        <p><em>Each of our I-Series L12 linear actuator models features a sophisticated, software-driven digital microcontroller.</em> This controller, which is fixed and non-programmable, automatically configures itself to one of four input modes during startup based on the connected leads. The available input options include 0-5V DC or PWM, 4-20mA or RC servo. The I-Series comes in two voltage variants, offering 6v and 12v models to cater to different power requirements.</p>
        <h3>2. L12-R Series</h3>
        <p>The R-Series L12 linear actuator interface adopts a standard hobby-grade, remote-control digital servo mechanism (CMOS logic). <em>Additionally, it seamlessly integrates with most RC receivers, offering plug-and-play compatibility.</em> Moreover, these units are fully operational with Arduino, utilizing the Arduino servo library for control. The R-Series is exclusively designed for 6v operations.</p>
        <h3>3. L12-S Series</h3>
        <p>Each model in our S-Series L12 linear actuators is equipped with end-limit switches. These switches automatically shut off the unit if it reaches its maximum extension or retraction. <em>Operating these units is straightforward: simply reverse the polarity on the actuator's two leads.</em> They are compatible with various control methods, including a DPDT switch, relay or brushed DC motor controller. The S-Series is also available in 6v and 12v models.</p>
        <h3>4. L12-P Series</h3>
        <p>P-Series L12 linear actuators are designed without an integrated controller. However, they provide an analog position feedback signal with an external controller. <em>These actuators are ideally paired with our <a href="https://www.actuonix.com/lac">Linear Actuator Control Board</a> (LAC), enabling control through various methods, including USB (using our Configuration Utility Software), 0-5v, 4-20mA, RC Servo or PWM.</em> The LAC also provides on-board options for adjusting speed, sensitivity and stroke limits, including stall protection features. The P-Series comes in 6v and 12v models.</p>
