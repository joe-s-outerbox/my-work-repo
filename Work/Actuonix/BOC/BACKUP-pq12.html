<div><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;">PQ12-Our Smallest Micro Linear Actuator</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Weighing in at just 15 grams, the PQ12 is incredibly light as well as compact. The PQ12 series of micro linear actuators are ideal for applications requiring precise positioning and compact size. The PQ12 is available with end of stroke limit switches or with linear feedback along the full length of stroke. A complete closed loop system can be realized with the addition of an LAC board.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The affordably-priced PQ12 is the most powerful actuator of it's size. This is why it has become a popular choice for OEM manufacturers as well as arduino and RC hobbyists. Some industries where the PQ12 are in use include:</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Prosthetics</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Robotics</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Medical</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Simulation</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The PQ12 is available with 3 different control options:</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;">PQ12-S Series</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><br style="font-size: 14pt;"></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">These units are operated by reversing polarity on pin 2&amp;3 of the actuator’s flat cable. The “S” series has end of stroke limit switches to that will turn off the unit if it runs into its end stop. These can be run with a DPDT switch, relay or brushed DC motor controller. The PQ12-S is available in 6v or 12v varieties.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;">PQ12-P Series</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The “P” series actuators feature an analog position feed­back signal that can be input to an exter­nal controller. The “P” series can plug directly into our Linear Actuator Control Board (LAC) to give the “P” series the ability to be controlled with USB (via our Configuration Utility Software), 0-5v, 4-20mA, RC Servo or PWM. On board adjustment of speed, sensitivity and stroke limits are also available via the LAC. The PQ12-P is available in 6v or 12v. Unlike the "S" series, the "P" does not have end-limit switches.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;">PQ12-R Series</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The PQ12-R series of linear servos operate as a direct replacement for standard rotary servos. They use the same standard 3 wire connector, ground power and control. Regardless of how you drive your servos, be it with an RC receiver, an Arduino board, or a VEX micro-controller, the PQ12-R servo will function in place of a regular servo, but with the added benefit of providing linear motion. The PQ12-R is available in a 20mm stroke coupled with gear ratio options of 30:1, 63:1 and 100:1 cover a large variety of applications. The "R" series is only available as a 6V unit.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 24px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt;">All of our actuators come with a mounting hardware kit included.</span></div>
