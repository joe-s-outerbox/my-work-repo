        <h2 class="mt-0">Find the Right T-16 For Your Project</h2>
        <p><em>Actuonix offers three distinct T16 linear track actuator models: the T16 P-Series, S-Series and R-Series, each tailored for specific applications and control requirements.</em></p>
        <h3 class="mt-0 mb-0">T16 P-Series</h3>
        <p>T16 P-series linear track actuators stand out for their versatility and adaptability in control options. <strong>While these actuators do not come with an integrated controller, they are equipped with a feature that provides an analog position feedback signal.</strong> This signal can be integrated with an external controller for precise motion control. The distinct advantage of the "P" series lies in its compatibility with the <a href="/lac">Linear Actuator Control Board</a> (LAC). <em>This compatibility offers various control methods, including USB, through our intuitive Configuration Utility Software, 0-5V, 4-20mA, RC Servo or PWM.</em></p>
        <p>Furthermore, the LAC board enhances the functionality of T16 P-series actuators by allowing on-board adjustments. Users can easily modify settings such as speed, end limits and sensitivity, tailoring performance to suit specific project requirements. </p>
        <h3 class="mt-0 mb-0">T16 S-Series</h3>
        <p>T16 S-series linear track actuators are engineered for straightforward and efficient operation. <strong>Motion back and forth is achieved simply by switching the polarity on the actuator's two leads.</strong></p>
        <div class="flex-row" style="justify-content: space-between;">
            <div class="col content" style="margin-left: 0;align-self: center; max-width: 400px;">
                <p>A key safety feature of this series is the integration of end-of-stroke limit switches. These switches are designed to automatically shut down the unit if it reaches its end stop, thereby preventing damage or overextension. <em>The versatility of the T16 S-series is further enhanced by its compatibility with various control methods.</em> T16 S-series actuators can be operated using a <a href="https://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Double-pole-double-throw-switch-DPDT" target="_blank">DPDT switch</a>, a relay or a brushed DC motor controller, offering flexibility in integrating different control systems. </p>

        </div>
        <h3 class="mt-0 mb-0">T16 R-Series</h3>
        <p>Enhance the functionality of your T16-P actuator by adding an <a href="/external-rc-control-board-.html">Ext-R adapter</a>, transforming it into an RC-compatible unit. This convenient adapter package comes complete with an RC extension cable, enabling effortless plug-and-play connection directly to your receiver. It's designed for simplicity and ease of use, ensuring that each T16-P actuator can be quickly and efficiently adapted for RC operation. This addition opens up new possibilities for integrating T16-P actuators into a broader range of remote-controlled applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> One Ext-R adapter is necessary for each actuator to achieve compatibility.</p>
