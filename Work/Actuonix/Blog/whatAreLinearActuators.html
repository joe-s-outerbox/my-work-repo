            <h2 id="ch1">How Does a Linear Actuator Work?</h2>
            <p>Linear actuators are controlled through a variety of methods, typically involving electronic signals. Covering every possible control method is outside the scope of this article, but we will touch on the more common ones below.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-position: inside;
            padding-left: 0;">
                <li><strong>DC Control.</strong> DC voltage is applied directly to the motor through a switch, relay, or other mechanism. Changing the polarity of the voltage supply allows the actuator to change direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).</strong>   Switching a digital signal on and off produces the equivalent of an analog DC signal, which can command an actuator to move to a certain position.  Varying the signal’s on-time vs. off-time (pulse width) will command the actuator to different positions.  This is a common control method when using microcontrollers in embedded systems.</li>
                <li><strong>PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers).</strong> PLCs are popular control systems in many fields, including industrial automation.  They can drive linear actuators with a variety of control signals, including 4-20mA current loops.</li>
                <li><strong>Servo Control.</strong> Some actuators operate as direct plug and play replacements for standard rotary servos. This type of control is compatible with arduino as well as most hobbyist radio control systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some linear actuators integrate feedback sensors, such as encoders or hall-effect sensors, which provide real-time information about the actuator's position, allowing for closed-loop control and enhanced accuracy.</p>

        <h2 id="ch2">Key Factors Influencing Actuator Performance</h2>
        <p>Linear actuator performance is influenced by several key factors. These include but are not necessarily limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The design and quality of the components, such as gearboxes or lead screws. This can affect the smoothness of the motion and the overall precision of the device.</li>
            <li>The choice of materials for guides and housing impacts durability and friction.</li>
            <li>Feedback systems, like sensors and limit switches, play a role in accurate positioning and safety.</li>
            <li>Voltage and current control mechanisms on the power source influence the actuator's speed, force, and responsiveness capabilities.</li>
            <li>Environment conditions. Such factors as temperature, humidity, and load weight can impact an actuator's efficiency and longevity</li>
        </ul>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Generally, it is best to avoid side-loading a rod-style linear actuator. If you have an application where a side load can not be avoided, you have a couple of options. Mounting the load on a linear slide rail and then driving the rail with a rod actuator is one choice to avoid side loading. Another option, if your design permits, is to use a track actuator which is more tolerant of side-loading.</p>
