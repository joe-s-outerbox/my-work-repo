        <h2 id="ch2">4 Types of Electric Actuators </h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Depending on how you categorize them, there are many different types of electric actuators. It’s possible to categorize actuators by input signal, voltage, motor type, output motion (rotary/linear) to name a few. This can make searching for actuators and understanding the tech behind them a little challenging at times. For this article, we are going to focus on four common types of electric actuators, and how each type of electric actuator works.</p>
        <h3>Linear Actuators</h3>
        <p>Electric linear actuators turn the rotary motion of a motor into linear motion by using a lead screw mechanism. They come in a variety of sizes from tiny micro linear actuators through to larger industrial actuators. They typically consist of a motor, gearbox, control system, lead screw mechanism and external housing.</p>
        <p>The simplest electric linear actuators are 2-wire devices that operate by switching the input voltage polarity. More complex actuators can accept other input signals including PWM, DC voltage, current loops or integrate with common or proprietary control systems. The motor turns a lead screw either directly or through a gearbox that allows for modification of the speed/force characteristics. The lead screw drives either a shaft (rod actuators) or a block (track actuators) to which the load is mounted.</p>
        <h3>Rotary Actuators</h3>
        <p>A rotary actuator is a mechanical device that uses an electric motor to turn a shaft, valve or other mechanism. It typically consists of an electric motor, gearbox, and control system to facilitate controlled movement. They are often used in industrial settings and are ideal for tasks requiring precise, rotational motion.</p>     
        <p>The motor shaft typically drives a component with a rotational force, either directly or through a gearbox mechanism. Rotary actuators are commonly used to control valves in liquid and gas systems.</p>
        <h3>Electromagnetic Actuators</h3>
        <p>An electromagnetic actuator is a device that generates mechanical motion through the interaction of magnetic fields. It typically consists of a coil or winding, a magnetic core, and a plunger or armature. When an electrical current flows through the coil, it produces a magnetic field that induces motion in the core or armature, enabling the actuator to perform various switching functions in applications like valves, relays, and solenoids. Due to their simplicity, electromagnetic actuators are a good choice for applications where cost and reliability are primary considerations. They’re ideal for quick, consistent actuations that do not require adjustable stroke.</p>
        <h3>Servo Actuators</h3>
        <p>A servo actuator is a device that integrates a servo motor with a feedback system to achieve precise control over position, speed, and torque. It operates in a closed-loop system, continuously adjusting its position based on feedback from sensors to maintain the desired position. Servo actuators are widely used in robotics, automation, and various industrial applications requiring accurate and responsive motion control. Servo actuators are often physically similar to rotary or linear actuators, but are functionally different. A servo actuator will always have a minimum of 3 wires, as it requires a signal that is separate from power. A servo actuator is capable of position control and can receive a command to go to a specific position, and then act on that.</p>

        <h2>Advantages of Electric Actuators</h2>
        <h3>Cost </h3>
        <p><strong>Electric actuators are typically less expensive to implement than other styles. Hydraulic and pneumatic actuators require expensive control systems for operation.</strong> Customizability Electric actuators are highly customizable. Motor voltage, stroke, force, mounts, cable length,  limit switches, and other aspects can often be customized by a manufacturer. Custom electric actuators can be a cost-effective way to meet the requirements of your product.</p>
        <h3>Mobility</h3>
        <p>Hydraulic and pneumatic actuators require fixed fluid or compressed air systems to operate making it impractical to move them around. <strong>Electric actuators just require power, which can be found nearly everywhere and so are more mobile by nature.</strong></p>
