        <h2 class="jump-target" id="increased-thirst">1. Increased Thirst and Frequent Urination</h2>
        <p>
            So, what are the symptoms of prediabetes? One of the earliest is increased thirst and frequent urination. Normally, the kidneys prevent the loss of glucose in the urine as long as the blood glucose level is below 180mg/dL. When blood glucose exceeds 180mg/dL it begins to spill over into the urine, taking water with it which results in increased urination and frequency. This in turn can result in dehydration and increased thirst.

        <h2 id="fatigue">2. Fatigue</h2>
        <p>
            Feeling tired all the time? Fatigue is one of the <strong>symptoms of prediabetes</strong>. It's an indication that your body isn't able to convert sugar into energy effectively because of the resistance to insulin action. When cells can't access glucose, the main fuel for energy, it can leave you feeling tired even after a full night’s sleep.

        <h2 id="blurred-vision">3. Blurred Vision</h2>
        <p>
            High blood sugar can affect your eyes by causing the lenses to swell, leading to blurred vision. This symptom is often intermittent depending on your blood glucose. While it might seem like a minor inconvenience, blurry vision may be an early indicator for high blood glucose.

        <h2 id="darkened-skin-patches">4. Darkened Skin Patches</h2>
        <p>
            Also known as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431057/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Acanthosis Nigricans</a>, darkening of the skin with velvety texture is a sign of insulin resistance which is the main cause of prediabetes. It can be one of the earliest signs of prediabetes. Acanthosis Nigricans is typically noted in the skin folds of the neck, groin, and armpits.

        <h2 id="slow-healing-wounds">5. Slow Healing Wounds</h2>
        <p>
            If you find that simple cuts take longer to heal than usual, it could be a sign of prediabetes. High blood glucose often weakens the immune system and promotes infection making it harder for wounds to heal.

        <h2 id="symptoms-of-prediabetes-in-females">6. Special Symptoms of Prediabetes in Females</h2>
        <p>
            Women may experience specific symptoms of prediabetes, like an increased risk of urinary tract infections ( <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9135-urinary-tract-infections" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">UTIs</a>) and irregular menstrual cycles. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that causes insulin resistance and high blood glucose which contributes to the development of prediabetes. These symptoms can be subtle, so women need to monitor any changes in their health and discuss them with a healthcare provider.

    <section>
        <h2 id="unexpected-weight-changes">7. Unexpected Weight Changes</h2>
        <p>
            Weight loss, especially when it's unexplained, can be a symptom of late stage prediabetes. When your body can't use glucose effectively because of the resistance to insulin this leads to an energy deficit that can cause weight loss.
