        <h2 class="jump-target" id="increased-thirst">1. Increased Thirst and Frequent Urination</h2>
        <p>
            So, what are the symptoms of prediabetes? One of the earliest is increased thirst and frequent urination. The kidneys must work harder to filter and absorb the excess sugar as blood glucose (sugar) levels rise. When they can't keep up, the sugar is excreted in your urine, pulling fluids from your tissues along with it. This leads to dehydration, making you feel thirsty more often, resulting in more trips to the bathroom.

        <h2 class="jump-target" id="unexpected-weight-changes">2. Unexpected Weight Changes</h2>
        <p>Weight gain or loss, especially when it's unexplained, can be a symptom of prediabetes. When your body can't use insulin effectively, it struggles to manage blood glucose levels, leading to energy deficits that can cause sudden weight loss. Conversely, insulin resistance can also lead to weight gain, particularly around the abdomen.</p>

    <section>
        <h2 id="fatigue">3. Fatigue</h2>
        <p>Feeling tired all the time? Fatigue is one of the <strong>symptoms of prediabetes</strong> in males and females. It's an indication that your body isn't able to convert sugar into energy effectively. When cells can't access glucose, your body starts running on empty, leaving you feeling drained even after a full night's sleep.</p>

        <h2 id="blurred-vision">4. Blurred Vision</h2>
        <p>High blood sugar can affect your eyes by causing the lenses to swell, leading to blurred vision. While it might seem like a minor inconvenience, ongoing vision problems could indicate your blood sugar levels are higher than normal. </p>

        <h2 id="tingling-or-numbness">5. Tingling or Numbness in Hands/Feet</h2>
        <p>
            An early sign of nerve damage is tingling or numbness in your hands or feet, which is due to high blood sugar. This condition, known as <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-peripheral-neuropathy-basics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">peripheral neuropathy</a>, is one of the first noticeable signs of prediabetes in females and males.

        <h2 id="darkened-skin-patches">6. Darkened Skin Patches</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK431057/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Acanthosis nigricans</a>, characterized by dark, velvety patches on the skin, is often associated with insulin resistance, a key factor in prediabetes. These patches commonly appear on the armpits, neck, or groin and can be one of the most visible signs of an underlying problem.

    <section>
        <h2 id="slow-healing-sores">7. Slow Healing Sores or Frequent Infections</h2>
        <p>
            If you find that cuts, sores, or bruises take longer to heal than usual, it could be a sign of prediabetes. High blood sugar often weakens the immune system and impairs circulation, making it harder for your body to fight infections and heal wounds.

        <h2 id="symptoms-of-prediabetes-in-females">8. Symptoms of Prediabetes in Females</h2>
        <p>
            Women may experience specific symptoms of prediabetes, like an increased risk of <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9135-urinary-tract-infections" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">UTIs</a> (urinary tract infections), polycystic ovary syndrome (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PCOS</a>), or irregular menstrual cycles. These symptoms can be subtle, so women need to monitor any changes in their health and discuss them with a healthcare provider.

        <h2 id="signs-of-prediabetes-in-males">9. Signs of Prediabetes in Males</h2>
        <p>
            In men, prediabetes can lead to symptoms like erectile dysfunction or decreased muscle mass. These signs are often overlooked but can be critical indicators of insulin resistance and should be taken seriously.

        <h2 class="h3 jump-target">Why Early Detection Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Prediabetes is a condition where your blood sugar is high but not enough to be categorized as type 2 diabetes. It's often dubbed the "silent" stage of diabetes because many people don't experience noticeable symptoms, making it easy to overlook. However, early detection is crucial. Recognizing the signs of prediabetes can prevent more severe health issues, including heart disease, nerve damage, and the development of Type 2 diabetes. Understanding these early symptoms empowers you to take control of your health before it escalates.
