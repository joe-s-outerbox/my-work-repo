    <h1>Warm / Hot and Cold Forging Presses</h1>
    
    <hr />
    <p>Stamtec is one of the few companies that manufacture forging presses. Our presses play an important role in a wide range of industries, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Industrial</li>
        <li>Automotive</li>
        <li>Aerospace</li>
        <li>Hardware</li>
        <li>Military</li>
        <li>Appliance</li>
        <li>Medical</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Parts made with our well-established, proven forging technology include hand tools, small gears, automotive shafts and steering components, bearing housings and connecting rods.</p>
    
    <p>Stamtec forging presses are available in a 220 to 4,000 tonnage range.</p>
    
    <p>Our cold and warm-hot forging presses can reduce material waste between 40% and 60%, making this technology one of the most economical methods for manufacturing high precision parts.</p>
    
    <p>Our forging presses also offer:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Near-net shapes</li>
        <li>Higher productivity</li>
        <li>Good surface quality</li>
        <li>Superior plasticity</li>
        <li>Better mechanical characteristics</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Cold forging presses manufacture stronger parts because the material is strain-hardened on a molecular level during the forging process, while hot-warm presses create parts that couldnâ€™t be made otherwise, thanks to the softened steel used in the process.</p>
    
    <p>All our forging presses offer a high rigidity frame and tie rods for maximum durability.</p>
    
    <p>Our <a href="index.php?Itemid=147&amp;lang=en-GB">cold forging presses</a> are equipped with knuckle joint drive systems, which can alter the motion velocity of the press slide to a slow speed as it approaches the bottom dead-end center point.</p>
    
    <p>Our <a href="index.php?Itemid=144&amp;lang=en-GB">hot-warm forging presses</a> <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;catid=10&amp;lang=en-GB" hreflang="en">&nbsp;</a>run on oversize eccentric shafts, which provide more accuracy and higher rigidity than eccentric gears or crankshafts.</p>
    
    <p>We offer a complete range of peripheral equipment, including transfer systems, feeders and knock-out devices, to create a fully automated press line. Stamtec also provides full product management through installation as well as complete aftermarket support from our U.S.-based facility.</p>

    <h3>Forging Press FAQ</h3>
    
    <p><strong>What types of drive systems are employed in your forging presses?</strong><br />
    We employ knuckle joint or heavy, oversized eccentric drive systems in our forging presses.</p>
    
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Why should I consider a forging press instead of a stamping press?</strong><br />
    Forging presses are ideal for producing near net-shaped parts, finished single-hit parts or parts that requires extreme force and rigidity.</p>
    
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Do you have cold forging and warm-hot forging presses?</strong><br />
    Yes. We carry both cold and warm-hot forging presses. In fact, we are one of the few major press manufacturers that offer forging presses.</p>
