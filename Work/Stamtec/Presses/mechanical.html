    <h2>Mechanical Press FAQ</h2>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>What tonnage mechanical presses do you offer?</strong><br /> We stock tonnage range from 25 to 600 and can provide custom built presses with tonnages of up to 3,000.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>What are the critical specs needed to determine the ideal mechanical press?</strong><br /> The specs we recommend assessing are tonnage, stroke length, die height, speed and bed and slide areas.</p>
    <hr />
    <p><strong>Can you tell me what kind of press I need for a particular application?</strong><br /> Yes, but you will first need to work with a qualified die builder (we can recommend a few) to determine the specs and capacities required of your press. We can then help you determine what type of press you will need based on this information.</p>
