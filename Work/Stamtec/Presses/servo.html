            <h2>Servo Press FAQ</h2>
            <hr />
            <h3>What kind of applications are Servo Presses ideal for?</h3>
            <p>Servo Presses are ideal for applications that require a variable slide velocity at multiple points in the stroke profile, including metal forming and shallow to medium drawing and forming.</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>What is the difference between a standard mechanical and Servo Press?</h3>
            <p>A Servo Press is driven by a servo motor, as opposed to a standard flywheel, clutch and brake. This provides full energy at any speed, but not full capacity at any stage in the stroke (capacity is best at near bottom center).</p>
            <hr />
            <h3>Should I use a Servo Press instead of a hydraulic press?</h3>
            <p>A Servo Press offers increased production volume when compared to a hydraulic press. Also, all stroke profiles are fully programmable on a Servo Press.</p>
