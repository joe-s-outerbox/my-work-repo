    <h2>Cold Forging Presses vs. Hot-Warm Forging Presses</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Material Strength:</strong>  Cold forging presses manufacture stronger parts because the material is strain-hardened on a molecular level during the forging process, while hot-warm presses create parts that couldnâ€™t be made otherwise, thanks to the softened steel used in the process.</li>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Both Cold and Hot-Warm forging presses offer a high rigidity frame and tie rods for maximum durability.</li>
        <li>Stamtec <a href="https://www.stamtec.com/cold-forging-presses">cold forging</a> presses are equipped with knuckle joint drive systems, which can alter the motion velocity of the press slide to a slow speed as it approaches the bottom dead-end center point.</li>
        <li>Stamtec <a href="https://www.stamtec.com/warm-hot-forging-presses">hot-warm forging presses</a> run on oversize eccentric shafts, which provide more accuracy and higher rigidity than eccentric gears or crankshafts.</li> 
    </ul>
