            <p>Below, we've addressed some common questions about our kitchen and bathroom trays. Please let us know if you need additional information.</p>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>How Many Soap Dispensers Does a Tray Hold?</h3>
                <p>A ceramic bottle tray can hold from 1-4 bottles, depending on the style of the tray and the size of the dispensers. If you have one dispenser, a coaster tray may work best.  However,  since most of our trays can hold multiple bottles, a <a href="https://thepolishedjar.com/collections/foamers">foaming hand soap dispenser</a> can be displayed next to a lotion dispenser.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>How Can I Ensure My Tray Lasts a Long Time?</h3>
                <p>Taking care of your tray involves minimal effort. Avoiding direct sunlight and excessive moisture can prevent damage and extend the life of your tray, especially for bamboo and marble bathroom trays. </p>
