                        When choosing how to display your custom feather flags with a pole, there are several options for ground hardware. A ground stake is our most popular option as it’s ideal for solid soil surfaces. A cross base is a four-legged, foldable base suitable for hard surfaces like an indoor trade show floor. For outdoor use, you can also choose a cross base with a water bag, which adds extra anchoring for stability. Our feather flags for sale provide versatile and eye-catching advertising solutions for any setting.

            <h2>Feather Flags FAQ</h2>
            <p>
                Custom feather flags are versatile and effective for improving visibility and directing traffic to your business or event. Below, we've compiled answers to common questions about our feather flag printing:
            </p>
            <h3>What's the difference between feather flags and tear drop flags?</h3>
            <p>
                Feather flags and <a href="https://www.uspress.com/product/teardrop-flags">tear drop flags</a> are closely related: both products are printed on polyester material, displayed on a pole, and often serve the same purpose. The key difference between the two is the shape of the flag, which comes down to your personal preference. Note that the shape of the flag determines the overall size as well as pricing, so be sure to check both of these products to find the best fit for your needs.
            </p>

            <h3>Where are feather banners usually displayed?</h3>
            <p>
                Most commonly, feather flag banners are displayed outdoors close to a road in order to draw attention to your business, organization, or event. When displayed outdoors, we recommend using our ground stake if you plan on inserting it into soil, or our cross base with water weight bag to add additional anchorage to a sidewalk. A cross base alone is sufficient for indoor use, such as at a trade show.
            </p>
            <h3>Is the pole included with my feather flag purchase?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, each custom printed feather flag kit includes an aluminum pole for display as well as a nylon bag for easy transportation.
            </p>
            <h3>Is the ground/base hardware included?</h3>
            <p> 
                By default, the base attachments are not included with your feather flag. However, simply select the base attachment of your choice using our pricing calculator above, and it will add it to your order.
