            <h3 class="accordion-head">Why Do I Need Beer Labels?</h3>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <div class="answer-wrapper">
                    <p>Beer labels are an important part of beer packaging and marketing, as they provide information about the beer and help to distinguish one brand or product from another. Key aspects of beer labels include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Branding:</strong> Beer labels often prominently display the brewery's name and logo, which helps create brand recognition and loyalty among consumers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Beer name and style:</strong> The label typically includes the specific name of the beer and its style (e.g., India Pale Ale, Stout or Pilsner).</li>
                        <li><strong>Alcohol content:</strong> Most beer labels display the alcohol by volume (ABV) percentage, which indicates the amount of alcohol in the beer. This information is vital for consumers to make informed choices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Some beer labels list the main ingredients used in the brewing process, such as malt, hops, yeast and water.</li>
                        <li><strong>Government warnings and regulations:</strong> In many countries, beer labels must include specific warnings about the potential risks of alcohol consumption. These warnings may relate to health issues, drinking and driving or alcohol consumption during pregnancy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Batch information and date codes:</strong> Some breweries include information about the specific batch of beer or a "best by" date on their labels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Artwork and design:</strong> Beer labels often feature unique artwork and designs that help set the product apart from others on the shelf.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Overall, beer labels serve multiple purposes, from providing critical information to consumers to helping breweries establish and maintain their brand identity.</p>
