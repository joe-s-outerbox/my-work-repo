<h2>Containment Pads Fuel Containment System Construction and Capabilities</h2>
Corrosion resistant fiberglass encapsulates each of our steel vehicle containment pads. Our quarter-inch-thick steel plates are coated in a nominal 1/16″ fiberglass lamination. And for U.V. protection, our containment pads include a gel-coat surface resin of equal chemical resistance.

Polystar’s low-profile fuel and hazardous liquid containment pads provide a crack-free surface. Both large tanker trucks or low clearance passenger cars and fuel tankers use Polystar Containment Pads for oil tank containment of liquid and hazardous materials spills.

Our Containment Pad tri-linear side walls prevent damage when driven over by heavy vehicles. An angular, composite, steel-cored stealth shape forms the tri-linear side walls, making this fuel containment system durable and reliable.
