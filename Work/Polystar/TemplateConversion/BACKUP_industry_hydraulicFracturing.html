<h1>Hydraulic Frac Tank Containment Solutions</h1>
Hydraulic fracturing, more commonly referred to as fracking, is an important aspect of oil and natural gas exploration and production. However, when oil drilling and well fracturing occur, there is a risk of oil and chemical spills occurring, requiring fac tank containment and prevention. These fracking tank spills can be damaging to the environment if they seep into the ground and contaminate various water sources. Take action to prevent environmental contamination that can occur when dealing with fracking completion, produced water, produced oil and more. Check out Polystar’s wide variety of hydraulic frac tank containment, oil field drilling spill prevention systems and frac tank containment solutions today.
<h2>SPCC Regulations and Frac Tank Secondary Containment</h2>
The EPA closely regulates oil and frac tank spill prevention through its <a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/about-us/resources/spcc-plan-requirements/">SPCC plan regulations</a>. There are significant fines and penalties for not complying with these regulations to ensure proper fracking tank containment. It is in your company’s best interest to establish the appropriate hydraulic frac tank containment, drilling containment, and <a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/product/poly-dike/">frac tank containment berms</a> before an incidental spill or catastrophic spill occurs.
