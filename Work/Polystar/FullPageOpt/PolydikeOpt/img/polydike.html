<h1>Poly Dike MPE® Secondary Spill Containment Walls</h1><span class="h3">An Effective Alternative to Concrete Containment Dikes</span>The Poly Dike MPE® containment dike wall is composed of durable, non-corrosive, high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Our
spill containment dikes provide superior protection for above-ground storage tanks. The containment dikes come in
standard and custom designs with variable heights between 12 and 48 inches. Our containment walls are most commonly used
as a secondary spill containment system for harmful liquid and solid materials such as:
<ul><li>Chemical storage tanks</li><li>Hazardous material work areas</li><li>Process treatment sites</li><li>Rainwater runoff diking</li></ul><h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Poly Dike MPE® Containment Wall Structure and Installation</h2>With the wall struts positioned, the entire secondary spill containment system ties together with a heavy-duty cabling
harness assembly. Pigtails ending in solid steel D-rings support all four sides of the harness assembly. These D-rings
slide into custom-designed slots in the wall struts where they are anchored in place by the locking connector. Stretching the harness assembly taut creates a unified, super-strong structure. After setting up the Poly Dike MPE
portable spill containment wall, a flexible liner is rolled out and draped over the wall struts. Securing the liner in
place with the innovative liner locks finishes the setup of your containment walls without damaging the liner. The Poly Dike spill containment dike is commonly bolted and sealed to a concrete pad or bolted together and used with a
flexible liner.
<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Transporting Your Containment Dike</h2>The modular, portable containment design of Poly Dike MPE® allows the components to be nested and stacked for simple
transportation and storage. <strong>The secondary spill containment system sets up quickly and easily without the need for special tools or lifting equipment.</strong>If you need to disassemble your dike containment walls and transport them to a new location, simply follow the
instructions for uninstalling your modular spill berm. Containment dikes can be reassembled in new designs and
configurations as needed. Not secured to the substrate, the Poly Dike MPE® is perfect as a long-term or temporary
containment wall for:
<ul><li>Parking Lots</li><li>Sand</li><li>Rocky Soil</li><li>Muddy Soil</li><li>Frozen Soil</li><li>Concrete Areas</li></ul><h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">The Benefits of the Poly Dike MPE Secondary Spill Containment System</h2>Aside from fulfilling SPCC and EPA standards, there are numerous other benefits of using a portable spill containment
dike at your facility or job site.
<ul><li>Limited site preparation</li><li>No excavation</li><li>Fast, clean installation</li><li>Immediate use</li><li>Non-porous design</li><li>Superior chemical resistance</li><li>Portability</li></ul><h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Our Poly Dike MPE® Containment Walls</h2><strong>For more than 20 years, we have been designing, engineering and manufacturing corrosion-resistant secondary spill containment systems.</strong>Along with our other spill prevention products, our aim is to keep employees and the
environment
safe while protecting companies against catastrophic loss. To learn more about us, check out our list of resources below
and learn more from some of these frequently asked questions.
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">&nbsp;</h3><span class="h3" style="margin-top: 20px;">We manufacture walls in 12”, 24”, 36” and 48” (36” wall with 12” riser) heights.</span><h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">How Do You Determine the Chemical Resistance of a Containment Wall?</h3>The containment walls themselves are polyethylene and have a wide range of chemical resistance. However, the walls are
used with a liner to create the containment. So, the only direct contact with the chemical should be with the liner.
Several types of liner are available — matching the liner to the specific chemical would be the best way to determine
chemical resistance.
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Do You Provide the Liners for Containment Dikes?</h3>We do not manufacture the liners used with the Poly Dike MPE. In the event you would like Polystar to source the liner,
we do have relationships with liner providers that allow us to source the liner for you.
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Is the Poly Dike MPE® secured to the substrate?</h3>The Poly Dike MPE® is not secured to the substrate. It is designed to sit on a level surface to create the proper
containment needed.
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Do you provide installation for the Poly Dike MPE?</h3>We do not provide installation, however, it is a simple process to install the system and requires no tools or heavy
lifting equipment.
