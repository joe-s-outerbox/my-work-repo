<p>Recently, hazardous battery materials have caused high-profile and uncontrollable catastrophic fires. The dangers of
    hazardous battery materials and the risk of electrocution prompted new industry standards for safer battery storage
    containers. Learn more about the <a
        href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/about-us/resources/energy-storage-systems-and-li-ion-battery-storage-compliance/">standard
        safety criteria</a> and how to stay compliant while reducing your risk of lithium battery fire or environmental
    contamination.
</p>
<h2>Who Uses Energy Storage Systems (ESS) with Battery Fire Protection?</h2>
<p>Energy storage systems, typically made of lead-acid or lithium-based batteries, provide backup power at hospitals and
    healthcare facilities, factories, and retail locations. They also regulate and clean grid power for data centers.
    Finally, energy storage systems offload energy when renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power
    generation, are unavailable.</p>
<h2>Stay Compliant with Energy Storage Systems or Commercial Battery Storage</h2>
            <p>To help prevent battery fires and ensure workplace safety, the <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)</a> released <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/nfpa-855-standard-development/855" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NFPA 855</a>, Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems. It is the first comprehensive collection of criteria for the fire protection of energy storage system (ESS) installations. These standard criteria provide requirements based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Technology used in energy storage systems</li>
                <li>Setting where the technology is being installed</li>
                <li>Size and separation of energy storage system installations</li>
                <li>Current fire suppression and control systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Stay compliant with NFPA 855 standards for energy storage systems and lithium battery safe storage by using fire-rated storage buildings designed to keep property, people, and the environment as safe as possible.</p>
