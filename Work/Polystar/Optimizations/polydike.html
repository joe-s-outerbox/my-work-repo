<h1>Poly Dike MPE® Spill Containment Walls</h1>
<p>
    <span class="h3">An Effective Alternative to Concrete Containment Dikes</span>
    The Poly Dike MPE® containment dike wall is composed of durable, non-corrosive, molded polyethylene. Our spill containment dikes provide superior protection for above-ground storage tanks. The containment dikes come in standard and custom designs with variable heights between 12 and 48 inches. Our containment walls are most commonly used as a <a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/about-us/resources/what-is-secondary-containment/">secondary spill containment</a> system for harmful liquid and solid materials such as:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/product/storage-building/">Chemical storage tanks</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/industry/general-industry/">Hazardous material work areas</a></li>
    <li>Process treatment sites</li>

</ul>
<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Poly Dike MPE® Containment Wall Structure and Installation</h2>

<p>For additional strength we offer a cabling harness, typically used in <a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/product/bladder-dike-mpe/">bladder containment</a>, the harness allows for catastrophic failure to be captured. With the wall struts positioned, the entire secondary spill containment system ties together with a heavy-duty cabling harness assembly.</p>
<p>After setting up the Poly Dike MPE portable spill containment dike, a flexible liner is rolled out and draped over the wall struts. Securing the liner in place with innovative liner locks finishes the setup of your containment walls without damaging the liner.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Transporting Your Containment Dike</h2>
<p>
    The modular, portable containment design of Poly Dike MPE® allows the components to be nested and stacked for simple transportation and storage. The secondary spill containment system sets up quickly and easily without the need for special tools or lifting equipment. If you need to disassemble your containment dike walls and transport them to a new location, simply follow the instructions for uninstalling your modular spill berm. Containment dikes can be reassembled in new designs and configurations as needed. Not secured to the substrate, the Poly Dike MPE® is perfect as a long-term or temporary containment wall for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Parking Lots</li>
    <li>Sand</li>
    <li>Rocky Soil</li>
    <li>Muddy Soil</li>
    <li>Frozen Soil</li>
    <li>Concrete Areas</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Our Poly Dike MPE® Containment Walls</h2>
<p>
    For more than 20 years, we have been designing, engineering and manufacturing corrosion-resistant <a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/product/">secondary spill containment systems</a>. Along with our other spill prevention products, our aim is to keep employees and the environment safe while protecting companies against catastrophic loss. To learn more about us, check out our list of resources below and learn more from some of these frequently asked questions.
</p>
<span class="h3" style="display: block; margin-top: 20px;">We manufacture walls in 12”, 24”, 36” and 48” (36” wall with 12” riser) heights.</span>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">How Do You Determine the Chemical Resistance of a Containment Wall?</h3>
<p>
    The containment walls themselves are polyethylene and have a wide range of chemical resistance. However, the walls are used with a liner to create the containment. So, the only direct contact with the chemical should be with the liner. Several types of liners are available — matching the liner to the specific chemical would be the best way to determine chemical resistance.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Do You Provide the Liners for Containment Dikes?</h3>
<p>
    We do not manufacture the liners used with the Poly Dike MPE. However, if you would like Polystar to source the liner, we have relationships with liner providers that allow us to do so.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Is the Poly Dike MPE® secured to the substrate?</h3>
<p>
    The Poly Dike MPE® is not secured to the substrate. It is designed to sit on a level surface to create the proper containment needed.
</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">Do you provide installation for the Poly Dike MPE?</h3><p>We do not provide installation, however, it is a simple process to install the system and requires no tools or heavy lifting equipment.</p>
