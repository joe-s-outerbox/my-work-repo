<h2>How Do You Conduct an Environmental Health and Safety Audit?</h2>
<p>The scope and breadth of your EHS audit depends on the needs of your business. <strong>To conduct your own EHS audit, identify factors such as the size of your business, focus areas and time to completion.</strong> Consider the following before conducting your audit:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify local, state and federal regulation requirements</li>
    <li>Assess how regulation requirements impact your business</li>
    <li>Develop processes to track tasks, trainings, spills, permits and other data</li>
    <li>Comply with your organization’s internal best practices and standards</li>
    <li>Be prepared for an unannounced, external auditor to arrive onsite</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Follow an EHS Audit Checklist?</h2>
<p><strong>When you follow a clear <a href="https://safetyculture.com/checklists/ehs-audit/">EHS audit checklist</a></strong>, you’ll cultivate a safer workplace environment, maintain a stronger emergency preparedness plan, and pivot more easily when regulatory EHS requirements evolve or update over time. While there is no one-size-fits-all checklist, according to OSHA, topics on your checklist can include<sup>1</sup>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Management leadership</li>
    <li>Worker participation</li>
    <li>Hazard identification and assessment</li>
    <li>Hazard prevention and control</li>
    <li>Education and training</li>
    <li>Program evaluation and improvement</li>
    <li>Communication and coordination for host employers, contractors, and staffing agencies</li>
</ul>
<p>To streamline the EHS audit, use technology to conduct paperless audits, review your audit data over time, and share your findings with company leaders to encourage transparent communication and implementation.</p>
<h2>What Are the Benefits of an Environmental Health and Safety Audit?</h2>
<p><strong>When you perform a voluntary, internal EHS safety audit</strong>, you can uncover areas for improvement and quickly address them instead of waiting for results from an unannounced, external auditor’s inspection.</p>
<strong>An EHS audit can help you:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Identify and resolve EHS compliance issues</li>
    <li>Improve workplace health and safety</li>
    <li>Reduce liability</li>
    <li>Find efficiencies and save costs</li>
    <li>Gain insight into current spill prevention and containment methods</li>
    <li>Increase awareness of regulations among employees</li>
