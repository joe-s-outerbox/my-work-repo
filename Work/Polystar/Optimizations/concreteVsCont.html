<h1>Concrete Containment Pads vs. Modular Spill Containment</h1>
<p>For centuries, humans have built roads, highways, bridges and entire cities out of concrete. When taking this intoconsideration, it may seem natural and logical to use concrete for industrial applications, such as <a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/government-requirements/">SPCC secondary spill containment</a>.
    <strong>Concrete containment pads have been in use for a long time, but that doesn’t mean their design is
        full-proof.</strong> Modular spill containment (a more recent form of secondary spill containment) may be far more beneficial to meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or Occupational Safety and <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.120AppC" target="_blank">Health Administration (OSHA) regulations</a>.</p>
<p>This article will briefly discuss the limitations of using concrete containment pads as a secondary containment system and offer a better solution. </p>
<h2>The Limitations of Concrete Containment Pads</h2>
<p>Concrete containment pads, structures and systems have long been the traditional solution for adequate secondary containment for various industries. Generally speaking, concrete containment pads consist of a poured concrete foundation, combined with vertical concrete walls, enforced with rebar. Once the concrete is poured, the interior is typically coated with epoxies, tars and polyurethane to prevent spilled chemicals from eating away at the structure.
</p>
<p>So, what's the problem with concrete containment pad design? <strong>While it may seem like a perfect solution, concrete secondary containment systems come with some serious limitations and weaknesses</strong>. Common limitations of concrete containment pad design include the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Concrete naturally develops cracks over time</li>
    <li>Concrete requires expansion joints to allow fluid to seep downward.</li>
    <li>Concrete decays over time.</li>
    <li>Concrete is inflexible and cannot be moved once poured.</li>
    <li>Concrete containment pad design allows rainwater and debris to collect in the overspill space. </li>
    <li>Concrete coatings are inflexible once cured and can crack along with the concrete.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A First-Hand Look at Concrete Containment Pad Design Flaws</h2>
<p>Let's look at a real-world example of how concrete containment pad design can be flawed. To the left is a concrete secondary containment system built in early 2000. This concrete containment pad was constructed to the highest standards and with the latest technology. </p>

        <p>Let's take a closer look.</p>
        <p> Functionally, this concrete containment pad is entirely ineffective for <a href="https://www.epa.gov/oil-spills-prevention-and-preparedness-regulations/secondary-containment-each-container-under-spcc" target="_blank"></a>SPCC purposes, as the concrete has cracked in multiple locations.</p>
        <p>This secondary containment system has developed cracks that run the entire width of each section, rendering it completely useless. That's six 14-foot-long cracks!</p>

        alt="Modular spill containment solution" width="175" height="131"><p><strong>A better, truly effective solution</strong> is a pre-fabricated <a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/product/containment-pad/">Polystar Containment Pad</a> that can be installed in just hours. It can be relocated as needed.</p>
    <p>These surface-mounted secondary containment systems won’t crack &amp; offer years of performance in the most extreme hot or cold conditions. Modular in all sizes, our secondary spill containment systems work for a variety of applications.</p>

<h2 style="clear: left;">Modular Spill Containment: A Better System</h2>
<p>If concrete containment pads are ineffective, what else can facilities use as secondary containment? A better, more effective solution comes in the form of a <a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/product/containment-pad/">Containment Pad</a> from Polystar Containment. Our Containment pads are manufactured from fiberglass encapsulated steel and can be customized to meet your specific containment needs and dimensions. <strong>Smaller designs can be delivered in a single piece, and larger designs can be manufactured in panels and assembled onsite.</strong></p>

<p style="clear: left;">Modular spill containment creates a barrier inside the walls to contain liquids and prevent fuel
    and other hazardous chemical spills from contaminating the environment. Because the pieces are modular, you can
    easily reconfigure the size depending on the needed application.</p>

<p style="clear: left;">You can install modular spill containment in just five hours and relocate it as necessary. These
    surface-mounted <a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/product/poly-dike/">secondary containment systems</a> won't crack and offer years of performance in extreme hot or cold
    conditions.</p>

<p>Polystar Containment can deliver and install (in the lower 48 states) a comparable 80-foot modular spill containment
    pad system for approximately 60% of the cost of the failed concrete containment pad system above.</p>
