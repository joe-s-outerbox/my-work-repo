Hazardous waste is divided into two categories: characteristic wastes and listed wastes. There is no regularly updated list of hazardous wastes, as the secondary containment for hazardous waste determination process involves many steps. However, facilities can ask questions to classify waste: <ul><li>Is the waste a solid waste?</li><li>Is the waste specifically excluded from the RCRA regulations?</li><li>Is the waste a listed hazardous waste?</li><li>Does the waste exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste?</li></ul><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=c94567294dff611654af7a3944a91d69&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt40.28.261" target="_blank">Learn more about Chemical Secondary Containment Requirements</a></div><div id="ch3" class="obx-section text-only wide"><img class="img-responsive alignnone wp-image-3278 size-full" src="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/requirements-for-chemical-storage.jpg" alt="requirements for chemical storage" width="724" height="483"><h2>Secondary Containment Requirements for Chemicals Under OSHA</h2>As part of the United States Department of Labor, the Occupational Safety and <a href="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/about-us/resources/safe-chemical-storage-osha-requirements/">Health Administration (OSHA)</a>promotes safe and healthy working conditions for Americans through standardized enforcement, training, community engagement, and education. <strong>Hazardous waste sites must comply with hazardous waste secondary containment requirements as determined by OSHA, including:</strong><ul><li>Site-specific occupational safety and health programs to protect employees</li><li>Training programs for employees that discuss expectations, techniques and procedures</li><li>Decontamination procedures tailored to specific site hazards</li><li>Emergency response plans</li><li>Personal protective equipment programs</li><li>An incident command system to control and manage operations during an emergency</li><li>Site and safety control plans</li><li>Medical surveillance programs</li><li>New technology and spill containment programs</li></ul>Facilities that handle hazardous waste must implement a secondary containment plan to contain and control accidental spilled material, as well as maintain employee safety. Traditional cleanup techniques include diatomaceous earth. However, modern options, such as secondary spill containment systems, provide first responders with more effective tools and methods for hazard reduction and cleanup. <strong>Some applications and devices for secondary containment for chemicals under OSHA include:</strong><ul><li>Portable pressurized applicators similar to fire extinguishers</li><li>Nozzle and hose systems similar to firefighting foam systems</li><li>Solidifying agents such as acid or caustic neutralizers, or activated carbon absorbents</li><li>Vapor suppression agents</li><li>Proper protective clothing</li></ul></div><div id="ch4" class="obx-section text-only wide"><h2>Secondary Containment Volume Requirements</h2><strong>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides volume requirements for secondary containment systems in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) found in Title 40 CFR 264.175(b).</strong>According to the RCRA act, secondary containment systems must be designed as follows: <blockquote>The secondary containment system must have sufficient capacity to contain 10% of the volume of containers or the volume of the largest container, whichever is greater. Containers that do not contain free liquids need not be considered in this determination. Run-on into the containment system must be prevented unless the collection system has sufficient excess capacity to contain any run-on which might enter the system. Excess capacity must be in addition to the 10% of the volume of containers or the volume of the largest container, whichever is greater.</blockquote><strong>States and municipalities must follow these federal volume requirements; however, many mandate stricter containment regulations.</strong>Explore your state and local regulations to ensure your facility is EPA compliant.
