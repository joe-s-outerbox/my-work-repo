                <h2>Find the Right Containment Solution to Meet Regulations</h2>
                <p>Any business or manufacturer that uses, stores or transports large amounts of hazardous or chemical liquids needs a containment solution to meet federal safety and environmental protection regulations. This need spans across industries and affects businesses depending on what liquid is used, where it is stored, and what it is used for. Regulations vary as certain liquids or materials cause more harm than others if a spill occurs.</p>
                <p>This makes understanding the difference between secondary and spill containment so critical. A spill containment solution may provide enough protection for liquids in preventing against environmental damage. With hazardous chemicals or waste requiring a constant secondary containment solution to prevent damage and protect the environment.</p>

                <h2>What is Secondary Containment?</h2>
                <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determines the requirements and federal regulations for preventing damage and protecting the environment against chemical or hazardous spills. According to regulations, what secondary containment looks like may vary. However, what secondary containment needs to do is abundantly clear. Secondary containment must hold the entire volume of liquids or materials should the primary container spill or fail.</p>
                <p>The most common types of secondary containment include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spill pallets or decks</li>
                    <li>Sloped floor that collects and holds liquids</li>
                    <li>A moat formed using dikes, berms or concrete walls</li>
                    <li>Absorbents</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What is Spill Containment?</h2>
                <p>The act of stopping a spill is spill containment. The objective of spill containment is to stop the spill from spreading. Less damage occurs the faster a spill is contained and cleaned up. Quick spill containment increases worker and jobsite safety, prevents environmental damage, and protects against wasted resources.</p>
                <p>Remember that spill containment is part of spill response. Spill response plans often contain different types of spill containment to address different types of spills. Common types of spill containment include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Absorbent socks and booms</li>
                    <li>Non-absorbent dikes</li>
                    <li>Drainage sumps designed to collect spilled liquids</li>
                </ul>
