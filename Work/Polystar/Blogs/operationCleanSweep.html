              <h2>What Is Operation Clean Sweep?</h2>
              <p><a href="https://opcleansweep.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Operation Clean Sweep (OCS)</a> is an industry-led initiative aimed at preventing the loss of plastic resins — pellets, flakes and powders — during handling by the various entities involved in the plastics industry.</strong> Founded by the <a href="https://www.plasticsindustry.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Plastics Industry Association</a> in 1991 and managed in partnership with the <a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/better-policy-regulation/plastics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">American Chemistry Council's</a> (ACC) Plastics Division, OCS underscores the plastics industry's commitment to achieving zero plastic resin loss in operations. The program operates globally, with participation from companies in over 60 countries, encompassing the entire plastics value chain from manufacturers and distributors of plastic materials to transportation companies and processors​​.</p>
              <p><strong>The essence of OCS is to foster a collaborative effort among all stakeholders in the plastics industry to minimize and ultimately eliminate plastic waste in the environment.</strong> This initiative aims not only to protect water bodies and wildlife from pollution but also to enhance worker safety and promote a circular economy by keeping plastics within the economic cycle rather than letting them become environmental waste​​.</p>
