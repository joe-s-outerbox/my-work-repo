                <h2>FAQs About Spill Prevention in the Workplace</h2>
                <p>Here are answers to some of our most common questions about spill prevention and avoiding cleaning up spills in the workplace.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>If an Unknown Chemical Spills in the Workplace, What Should You Do?</h3>
                <p><strong>If you encounter an unknown chemical spill in the workplace, evacuate employees from the area to avoid harmful exposure and initiate spillage containment procedures immediately.</strong> Utilize spill berms or other spill prevention tools to control the spread of the substance. It's critical to consult the <a href="https://www.ready.gov/business/emergency-plans/emergency-response-plan" target="_blank">Emergency Response Plan</a> for guidance on how to prevent spillage and manage the situation safely. Until the chemical's identity is confirmed, treat it as highly hazardous and follow strict chemical spill prevention protocols to ensure the safety of the workplace and employees.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>Why Is It Important to Ensure That All Spills That Occur in a Workstation Are Cleaned Immediately?</h3>
                <p><strong>Even if you know how to prevent spillage, unavoidable accidents happen.</strong> Efficient spillage containment helps maintain operational continuity, preventing costly downtime and preserving workplace safety. If an accident happens, cleaning up spills without delay is crucial, especially with chemical spills in the workplace. Immediate action reduces the risk of slip hazards and exposure to potentially dangerous chemicals, embodying the principles of chemical spill prevention. Quick response is not only a safety measure but also a compliance matter, as it aligns with regulations on spill prevention in the workplace.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>What Are the 4 Cs of Spill Response?</h3>
                <p><strong>The "4 Cs" of spill response are a set of recognized best practices for managing and cleaning up spills in the workplace.</strong> They represent a structured approach to quickly and effectively address spills, aiming to minimize environmental impact, human health risks and property damage. This method ensures proper containment to prevent spillage spread, control measures to stop further release, thorough cleanup to remove contaminants and clear communication with relevant parties for a coordinated response. These steps are crucial for maintaining safety and regulatory compliance during spill incidents.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Control the spill:</strong> Implement spill prevention strategies to manage the immediate threat and prevent further spread of the chemical spill in the workplace.</li>
