<h2>Understanding Railcar Transloading Spill Containment</h2><h3>What is railcar transloading spill containment?</h3><p><strong>Transloading is the process of transferring liquids from railcars to trucks and vice versa.</strong>The federal government requires <a href="https://www.epa.gov/oil-spills-prevention-and-preparedness-regulations">spill prevention containers</a>or “railcar secondary containment” to catch incidental spills that may occur during railroad transfer operations.</p><h3>Do I need a railroad transloading plan?</h3><p>Most transloading facilities need a transloading spill containment plan with railroad spill containment to meet federal safety guidelines. You need a transloading plan if there is a likelihood of oil discharge into local navigable waterways and if your facility handles petroleum and/or non-petroleum oils, among other criteria.</p><img src="https://www.polystarcontainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/railcar-spill-containment.jpg" alt="railcar fuel oil containment">
