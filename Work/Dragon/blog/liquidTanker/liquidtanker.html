                <h2 id="ch3">Different Types of Tanker Trailers</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several different types of tanker trailers, each designed to serve a specific purpose. Let's delve into some of the most common types of tanker trailers.
                </p>
                <h3>Chemical Tanker Trailer</h3>
                <p>
                    This specialized trailer is designed to transport hazardous chemicals and liquids that require a high level of safety and security.

                    <div class="list-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chemical</li>
                            <li>Pharmaceutical</li>
                            <li>Petrochemical </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                <h3>Crude Hauler</h3>
                <p>
                <strong>A <a href="https://dragonproducts.com/liquid-transport-trailers-2/crude-oil-trailers/">crude hauler</a> is designed to transport gasoline, diesel and other fuel types.</strong> It's generally equipped with multiple compartments and pumping systems for efficient loading and unloading. Separate compartments also allow you to carry more than one type of fuel in your tank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A crude hauler is designed to transport products like:
                                    </p>
                    <div class="list-container">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gasoline</li>
                            <li>Jet Fuel</li>

                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>In addition, a crude hauler can enhance the trailer's safety by preventing a liquid surge. At least 6 different factors can cause a liquid surge in a tank trailer:</p>
                    <div class="list-container">
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sudden acceleration or deceleration</li>
                            <li>Cornering</li>
                            <li>Sloshing</li>

                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <p>Given the hazardous nature of the products a crude hauler transports, it's no wonder these liquid tank trailers are subject to stringent regulations.<em>If you're in the market for a crude hauler, choose a reputable dealer like Dragon Products to ensure their tankers comply with all necessary safety regulations.</em></p>

                <h2 id="ch4">Frequently Asked Questions About Different Types of Tanker Trailers</h2>
                <p>
                    Given all the different types of tanker trailers, it's not unusual to have questions about them. We've answered a few of these here, but if you want more details about our tanker trailers or any of the equipment we provide, please get in touch.
                </p>
                <h3>What Are Liquid Tanker Trailers?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Liquid tanker trailers are specialized vehicles that transport liquids, gases or bulk solids in large quantities.</strong> They consist of a tank mounted on a chassis that's pulled by a truck or tractor.</p>
                <h3>What's the Difference Between an LNG and an LPG Transport Trailer?</h3>
                <p>
                    LPG and LNG are both hydrocarbon gases. <strong>Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) transport trailers are specialized vehicles for transporting and delivering these gases to various destinations.</strong> LPG – aka butane or propane – is highly flammable and includes a mix of hydrocarbon gases. LPG is prized as a clean, portable, energy-efficient and affordable fuel. It's used to power heating and cooking appliances and to fuel vehicles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    LNG is a natural gas chilled to liquid form. This process transforms natural gas into a non-pressurized material that can be transported and stored safely, easily and affordably. It occupies far less volume than natural gas, which means it's also a space saver. LNG is odorless, colorless, non-toxic, non-corrosive and eco-friendly. It's used to operate expensive and sensitive machinery and equipment.
                                    </p>
                <h3>How Are Tanker Trailers Loaded and Unloaded?</h3>
                <p>
                    Liquid tanker trailers are typically loaded and unloaded through the top or bottom of the tank, depending on the kind of cargo being transported. Some tankers have built-in pumps or compressors to facilitate loading and unloading.
                </p>
                <h3> How Are Tanker Trailers Maintained?</h3>
                <p>
                    Tanker trailers require <a href="https://dragonproducts.com/fuel-tank-trailer-maintenance-and-cleaning-guide/">regular maintenance and cleaning</a> to ensure safe and reliable operation. This includes inspections of the tank, chassis and mechanical components — and cleaning and testing the tank to ensure it's free from leaks and contamination.
                </p>
                <h3>What Safety Measures Are Required When Operating Liquid Tanker Trailers?</h3>
                <p>
                    Operators of tanker trailers must adhere to strict safety guidelines to prevent accidents and spills. This includes proper loading and unloading procedures, regular maintenance and inspections and compliance with <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hazardous-materials/how-comply-federal-hazardous-materials-regulations">hazardous materials transportation regulations</a>.
