                Industrial storage tanks are essential for worksites in many industries, housing liquid materials like
                diesel fuel, crude oil, water, sewage and chemicals inside. Whether underground or above-ground, these
                workhorses must be managed safely and require special industrial storage tank maintenance, including
                inspections and repairs. This article will discuss how to ensure safety in and around industrial storage
                tanks, what maintenance is needed to keep them operating effectively and how Dragon Products can help
                with support that goes far beyond an initial purchase.

            <h2 id="ch1">Why Industrial Storage Tank Safety Is Important</h2>
            <p>
                Potential hazards lurk in and around a fuel storage tank. Whether your tank is old or brand new, there
                is a risk of asphyxiation, fire, entrapment, falls from ladders, chemical exposure and shock.
                <strong>You need a comprehensive workplace safety program that protects workers' health and complies
                    with OSHA regulations.</strong>

            <p>
                Fortunately, there are several things you can do to ensure the safety of workers in and around your
                industrial storage tank. By drawing up a storage tank safety plan and making compliance mandatory, you
                can avoid workplace injury and improve the effective operation of your worksite. Your safety plan should
                cover several important topics.

            <h3>Job Hazard Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>A thorough job hazard analysis should be completed</strong> when the industrial storage tank
                arrives on your worksite. For optimal compliance, create a pre-entry checklist that outlines the hazards
                and tasks to be completed by your workers. If you discover unsafe work conditions, explore alternatives.

            <h3>Space Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                When workers need to enter the industrial storage tank for any reason, they must use the Confined Space
                Entry Permit system. OSHA created this system to protect workers from injury when performing tasks in
                confined spaces. <a href="https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/osha/confined/definitions.asp">OSHA defines a
                    confined space</a> as one that:
            </p>
            <div class="list-container" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                <ol>
                    <li>"Is large enough and so configured that an employee can bodily enter and perform assigned work;
                        and</li>
                    <li>Has limited or restricted means for entry or exit (for example, tanks, vessels, silos, storage
                        bins, hoppers, vaults, and pits are spaces that may have limited means of entry.); and</li>
                    <li>Is not designed for continuous employee occupancy."</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>
                The process takes the workers and their supervisor through an evaluation of the confined space. The <a
                    href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/2018-12/fy11_sh-22318-11_Mod_6_CSPermit.pdf">Confined
                    Space Entry Permit</a> is used to establish acceptable conditions for entering the industrial
                storage tank. Each time an employee enters the confined space, an entry permit is completed by an
                Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) inspector. The contents of the permit are then communicated to all
                involved. The permit is also posted near the location of the industrial storage tank.
            </p>
            <h3>Enhanced Visibility</h3>
            <p>
                Storage tanks commonly have limited entry and exit points. You need to ensure these areas are well-lit
                to avoid potential injury.
            </p>
            <h3>Industrial Storage Tank Warning Signs</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Make sure you post warning signs around your storage tank</strong> to caution anyone working
                around the tank. Warnings should include anything that could potentially create a liability for your
                company, such as if your fuel storage tank has hazardous contents, any access restrictions and other
                communication required to warn unauthorized workers and visitors.
            </p>

            <h3>Proper Protection</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as earplugs, respirators, gloves and eye protection,
                    must be accessible and mandated for use</strong> by workers accessing the industrial storage tank.
                As the worksite manager, you're also responsible for ensuring workers use proper fall-protection
                equipment and the right tools and monitoring equipment.

            <h3>Emergency Procedures</h3>
            <p>
                Work with local responders to formulate a plan for emergencies. If a worker falls or is exposed to
                harmful chemicals, make sure you have a procedure in place and post this protocol along with contact
                phone numbers in a prominent place near the storage tank.

            <h3>Increased & Continuous Safety Training</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Safety measures for your industrial storage tank must be reviewed periodically</strong> to
                ensure their relevance, incorporate any new strategies and identify any opportunities for enhancement.
                It's also a good idea to request workers' feedback on safety issues since they are on the frontlines.
                Employees must be provided with the duties, essential controls and expectations you've established to
                ensure their safety.

            <p>
                While you may not imagine there's much to do in the way of tank maintenance, there are certain things
                required to ensure the proper operation of your industrial storage tank. <strong>Creating an effective
                    maintenance strategy right from the start helps mitigate any surprises down the road.</strong>

            <h3>What's the Worst That Could Happen?</h3>
            <p>
                Water vapor and bacteria can result from a lack of tank maintenance. Water vapor condenses, causing
                microbial growth, which in turn results in microbial contamination in the fuel system. This means you're
                going to incur hefty repair costs and lose the services of your fuel storage tank while it's being
                fixed. If you notice a change in fuel color, it's a good indication that your fuel is contaminated. When
                this happens, you may experience:

                        To avoid contamination of your fuel or crude oil tank, it's best to prevent bacteria from forming in
                        the
                        first place. You can do this by performing the following fuel tank maintenance:

                                fuel.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Fuel Storage Maintenance</strong>: Minimize exposure to water through fuel tank
                                insulation and routine discharge of water from the bottom of the tank.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cleaning</strong>: Remove sludge regularly and perform scheduled cleanings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fuel Treatment</strong>: Use EAP-approved diesel fuel biocides between tank
                                cleanings.
