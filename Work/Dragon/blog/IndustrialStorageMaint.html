            <h3>Space Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                When workers need to enter an industrial storage tank for any reason, they must use the Confined Space Entry Permit system. OSHA created this system to protect workers from injury when performing tasks in confined spaces. <a href="https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/osha/confined/definitions.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">OSHA defines a confined space</a> as one that:
            </p>
            <div class="list-container" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                <ol>
                    <li>"Is large enough and so configured that an employee can bodily enter and perform assigned work.</li>
                    <li>"Has limited or restricted means for entry or exit (for example, tanks, vessels, silos, storage bins, hoppers, vaults, and pits are spaces that may have limited means of entry.)</li>
                    <li>"Is not designed for continuous employee occupancy."</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>
                Before entering a confined space like an industrial storage tank or fuel storage tank, workers and supervisors must complete the <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.146" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Confined Space Entry Permit</a>, ensuring all safety protocols are followed. This process involves a thorough evaluation of the space to establish acceptable conditions for entry. Each time an employee enters the confined space, the permit is completed by an Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) inspector, communicated to all involved personnel, and posted near the industrial storage tank to ensure transparency and compliance.
            </p>
            <h3>Enhanced Visibility</h3>
            <p>
                Given that industrial storage tanks and fuel storage tanks often have limited entry and exit points, ensuring these areas are well-lit is essential for worker safety. Sufficient lighting reduces the risk of accidents such as slips, falls, or improper use of equipment during industrial storage tank maintenance or oil tank cleaning. Installing reliable lighting systems both inside and around the industrial storage tank will improve visibility, enabling workers to perform their tasks efficiently and reducing the likelihood of injury.
            </p>

            <h3>Proper Protection</h3>
            <p>
                Workers must use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when accessing industrial storage tanks and fuel storage tanks. <strong>Essential PPE includes items such as earplugs, respirators, gloves, and eye protection.</strong> As the worksite manager, it's your responsibility to make this equipment easily accessible and mandate its use. In addition to PPE, you must ensure workers are equipped with proper fall protection gear and the right tools for fuel tank maintenance, oil tank cleaning, and other tasks. Regular checks on monitoring equipment are also necessary to prevent exposure to hazardous materials or unsafe conditions during industrial storage tank maintenance operations.
