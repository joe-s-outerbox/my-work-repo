<h2>When Were Bags Invented & Who Invented Them?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">With mentions throughout the documented history of all civilizations, it's impossible to
    know who invented bags. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">However, the invention of <em>burlap</em> bags can be traced to 1793 India, where fibers
    from the native jute plant were woven together to create burlap fabric. And until the mid-19th century, this is how
    bags were made – by hand, using natural materials.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 80px;">When Were Paper Bags Invented? </h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Mass-produced paper bags were invented in 1852, with one major drawback – they didn't have
    bottoms. At this point, you're probably wondering: <em> Is a bag without a bottom…a bag?</em> </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">"Large, not terribly useful paper envelopes" more accurately describes the output of this
    new machine, but no matter – it was a 19th-century disruption. A machine-made, disposable carrier unlike anything
    seen before? It's no surprise their inventor was able to call them whatever he liked.</p>

<div id="grey-bg" style="margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
    <h2>Square-Bottomed Grocery Bag Design</h2>
    <p>Margaret Knight, a worker at a paper bag company, invented a mechanism to automate the process of making paper
        bags with a flat, square bottom, which revolutionized the industry and made square-bottom paper bags the norm.
        Despite the eventual dominance of plastic bags in the market, the design of the functional grocery bag has
        remained popular over time, with modern paper bags still using updates of Knight's patented machine, and new
        bags made from modern materials still maintaining the classic square-bottom shape.</p>
    <p>For instance, PackIt's Freezable Grocery Tote has the shape of a block bottom bag but with advanced materials
        that provide structural integrity, a comfortable carry and cooling capabilities that paper could never deliver.

        <li><strong>Temperature control</strong> — This is essential to keep your breast milk cool for an extended time.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Capacity</strong> — Think about the amount of milk you typically need to transport and look for a
            bag that can accommodate that many bottles (or more).</li>
        <li><strong>Durability</strong> — Look for sturdy materials that can withstand regular use, cleaning and travel.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Ease of use</strong> — Choose a bag that is easy to open and close and has convenient features, like
            a comfortable handle.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Safety</strong> — Make sure the bag is BPA-free and free of other harmful
            chemicals.</li>
    </ul> -->

<h2>Paper Bag History Develops With New Additions</h2>
<p>In 1912, a St. Paul, Minnesota grocer invented a reinforced, handled shopping bag after seeing his customers struggle
    to carry brown grocery bags. On behalf of all shoppers everywhere, thank you, Walter Deubener. </p>
<p>This part of paper bag history is as enduring as the square-bottom bag. The best modern grocery bag designs include
    reinforced seams and handles or straps to carry more, farther.</p>


<h2 style="margin-top: 80px;">Paper or Plastic? Bag History Takes a Turn</h2>
<p><strong>America's plastic bag history started in 1979</strong>, and by the 1990s, plastic bags had taken over the
    world. </p>
<p>The obvious advantage for retailers was that they were much cheaper than paper bags. Shoppers preferred them because
    durable and weather-resistant plastic proved relatively easier to carry. </p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 80px;">What We Know Now About Our History of Bag Choices</h3>

<p>The Swedish engineer who invented the one-piece, high-density polyethylene grocery bag in 1965 thought it was better
    for the environment because it was reusable and saved trees. However, plastic bags are so cheap to make and easy to
    use that they have become a single-use product due to convenience, with serious environmental consequences.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The original breast milk cooler includes a clear pocket for a name and date card. Plus, you
    get your pick of fun styles like polka dots.</p>
<p>Eight states have banned single-use plastic bags, and some of the nation's largest retailers, like Walmart and
    Kroger, are planning a nationwide ban or pilot-testing bagless stores. Similar efforts have been made all over the
    world. </p>
<p>Although the history of bags has a dark side, today's policymakers and consumers are wiser to the realities of
    plastic pollution, and many people are choosing alternatives for getting their purchases home. The demand has
    created new styles of grocery bags that are better than ever, and transporting fresh food has never been easier.

    <!-- <h2>When to Use a PackIt Breast Milk Cooler Bag</h2> -->
    <p>We all love a good bag, but have you ever stopped to think about the environmental impact of your bag choice?
        Here are some mind-blowing stats that might just make you rethink your go-to carry-all:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Did you know that paper manufacturing in the US alone accounts for a whopping <a
                href="https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-pulp-and-paper-industry/paper-industry-energy-and-ghg-reductions"
                target="_blank">4% of all energy consumption</a> and greenhouse gas emissions? Yikes.</li>
        <li>And what about paper bags? While they may seem like the eco-friendly option, they actually require cutting
            down trees, with an estimated <a
                href="https://cleanair.org/wp-content/uploads/Paper-Bags-Environmental-Fact-Sheet.pdf"
                target="_blank">14 million trees</a> chopped down each year in the US just for paper bags.</li>
        <li>For plastic bags, did you know that a staggering <a
                href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/plastic-in-our-oceans" target="_blank">10 million tons</a>
            of plastic end up in our oceans every year, threatening marine life and ecosystems? Not cool.</li>
        <li>But there's hope yet! Several cities and countries are taking action by <a
                href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/plastic-bag-bans.aspx"
                target="_blank">banning or taxing single-use plastic bags</a>, with the European Union leading the way
            by implementing a ban in 2019. So let's all do our part by choosing reusable bags and supporting initiatives
            that promote sustainability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">These stats show that our bag choices can have a big impact on the environment. Let's
        all make conscious choices and help protect our planet!</p>
</div>

<h2 style="margin-top: 80px;">Reusable but Cooler Grocery Bag Design</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The 90s saw what a plastic bag habit can do to a planet, and the modern reusable tote was
    born. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Over the years, improved materials like insulation have been incorporated into reusable
    grocery bag designs. Perishable foods can go without refrigeration for one to two hours, and insulation helps make
    the most of that time – but only by adding ice or ice packs can you keep foods safe for longer than two hours. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">PackIt is the bag that's an ice pack, with the features of a traditional reusable tote plus
    the functionality of a cooler. None of the many different types of grocery bags, with or without insulation, have
    PackIt's built-in cooling capabilities.</p>
