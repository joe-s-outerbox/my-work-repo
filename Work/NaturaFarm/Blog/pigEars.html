<h2><strong>Pros of Pig Ears For Dogs</strong></h2>
<p><span>While the idea may seem a bit unconventional, there are many pros to giving your dog all-natural pig ear chews.
  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Nutritional Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>Pig ears are incredibly easy to chew because they are softer cartilage, making them the perfect treat for senior dogs
  with dental problems.</p>
<p>Pig ears also carry an impressive amount of glucosamine and chondroitin. These naturally-occurring compounds relieve
  osteoarthritis in dogs.</p>
<p>In addition to the above benefits, pig ears also contain 69% valuable protein for developing more robust muscles.</p>
<h3><strong>Behavioral Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>Chewing pig ears can keep your dog busy for extended periods. Chewing stimulates their brain and keeps them
  preoccupied long enough to avoid destructive behaviors brought about by boredom and restlessness.</p>

  <h2><strong>Cons of Pig Ears For Dogs</strong></h2>

      are no exception.</span></p>
  <p><span>If given freely to them as a part of their regular diet, they risk becoming obese. A high-fat diet can lead
      to pancreatitis in many dogs, leading to extreme abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.</span></p>

      may contain salmonella and other bacteria, which cause very harmful reactions in dogs.</span></p>
