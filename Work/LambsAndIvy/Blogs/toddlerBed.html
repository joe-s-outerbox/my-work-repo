    After going through the crib-to-toddler bed transition three times with my little ones, I’ve learned that it’s more than just swapping out beds—it’s about timing, safety, and making sure your child feels ready and secure. Each kid handles the change differently, and figuring out when to transition to a toddler bed can feel a bit overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
    In this guide, I’ll share what worked (and what didn’t) from my own experience, along with expert tips to help you decide when the time is right.
</p>
<p>
    Whether you’re wondering if your child is ready, dealing with nighttime escapes, or just trying to avoid bedtime battles, this guide will share advice for a smooth transition.

<h2 id="ch1">When to Transition to a Toddler Bed</h2>
<p>
    How do you know when to move your baby to a toddler bed? The answer may be different for every family. Here’s what you need to know to make the decision. 
</p>
<h3>Ideal Age for Transition</h3>
<p>
    Most children are ready to transition to a toddler bed between <strong>18 months and 3 years</strong>, according to experts at <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/children-and-sleep" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Sleep Foundation</a>. However, this wide range can feel tricky for parents to navigate—what works for one child may not work for another. <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/from-crib-to-toddler-bed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. O’Connor at the Cleveland Clinic</a> says that parents should look to their child for cues like outgrowing the bed or asking to move to a big kid bed. We’ll cover a detailed list of signs below.
</p>
<p>
    Some children may be ready to move to a toddler bed earlier than others. By observing your child, you can make the best decision. 
</p>
<h2 id="ch2">4 Signs Your Child is Ready for a Toddler Bed</h2>
<p>Some signs your child is beyond the crib age are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Climbing Out of the Crib:</strong> If your child has climbed out or tried to climb out of the crib, it’s time to make the move. Climbing out of the crib can be dangerous, as it’s a long drop from the top railing. Avoid accidents by transitioning to a toddler bed if your little one is a climber. </li>
    <li><strong>Outgrowing the Crib:</strong> When your child is about 3 feet tall, they are more likely to be able to climb out of the crib. Plus, the fit might be getting tight. </li>
    <li><strong>They Want a “Big Kid Bed”:</strong> Perhaps your child has heard about a cousin or a friend at daycare moving into a toddler bed. Or maybe your little one has seen your bed and wants something similar. If your child decides they’re toddler bed aged, take that as a sign to prepare for the transition. </li>
    <li><strong>Your child exhibits some self-control:</strong> Once your child can get out of bed independently, they can get into trouble. You’ll want to be sure your child won't get into trouble, such as turning on the stove or making a mess in the bathroom. If you can trust your child for a few minutes without supervising them directly, they may be mature enough. </li>
</ul>
<p>If your child exhibits several of these signs, they may be ready for a toddler bed. </p>
<h2 id="ch3">How I Transitioned My Child to a Toddler Bed</h2>
<p>As a mom of three, deciding when to transition to a toddler bed was different for each child.</p>
<h3>My Daughter (18 Months)</h3>
<p>
    My daughter wanted her own bed at a very young age. She was about 18 months old when we moved her to a floor bed. She liked being able to get into and out of bed independently.
</p>
<h3>My Youngest (Wild Sleeper)</h3>
<p>
    My youngest has always been a bit of a wild sleeper. We waited until he was a bit older to transition to a toddler bed because we were worried he’d fall right out of bed. 
</p>
<h3>My Oldest (Around 2 Years Old)</h3>
<p>
    Transitioning my two younger children to toddler beds was easy because they had the example of their older brother. They wanted to be just like him and have a big kid bed. With my oldest, I knew that I wanted to move him because I was pregnant with my daughter.
</p>
<p>
    We decided to start the process early during my pregnancy so he wouldn’t feel displaced by his little sister. He was about 2 years old when we made the switch. Here are the steps we took with him. 
</p>
<h3>Involving Your Child</h3>
<p>
    First, I talked to him about it. I made it sound like something exciting and reminded him that he was growing up. 
</p>
<p>
    A few days later, we set up his new bed. We involved him in this process. One way we got him involved was by having him help pick out his <a href="https://lambsivy.com/collections/toddler-bedding-sets">toddler bedding</a>. This was very exciting for him and he loved picking it out. It made the transition much easier because he looked forward to using his new sheets and blanket. 
</p>
<h3>Preparing the Room</h3>
<p>
    Because my son was going to have more access to his room without supervision, we also did some more child-proofing. A few things to consider are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Anchoring furniture to the walls.</li>
    <li>Covering electrical outlets.</li>
    <li>Removing any potential hazards, such as curtain cords</li>
    <li>If you don’t have a baby gate at the bottom or top of stairs in your home, consider whether you need one. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Maintaining Routines</h3>
<p>
    We used the same bedtime routine as before to help my son adjust to the change. Maintaining routines like reading a book before bed can help your child feel secure in the midst of change. 
</p>
<h3>Starting with Naptime</h3>
<p>
    Some families find that it’s easier for their child to sleep in their toddler bed for a nap first. It’s still light outside, and your child might feel more relaxed.
</p>
<p>
    In our case, my son was refusing to take naps and only fell asleep sometimes in the afternoons. So, we just gave him plenty of time to get used to the new bed throughout the day. That way, it felt more familiar at night. 
</p>
<h3>Using Tools and Tricks</h3>
<p>
    Now that your child has more freedom to get in and out of bed, you might also consider using some helpful tools.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
<strong>OK to Wake Clock:</strong> This clock is a combination night light and alarm light. When it’s OK for your child to get out of bed, the light will change colors. You can set the clock. For example, if you want your child to wait until 6:30 AM, you can set the clock for that time. This can help your child learn to stay in bed until later.<br><br><p>As a mom, I have found it helpful to prepare my child ahead of time with ideas of what they can do while waiting. For example, you can keep some books on the nightstand that your child can look at while waiting for it to be time to get up. </p><br>
    </li>
    <li>
<strong>Bedtime Pass:</strong> Create a “bedtime pass.” Your child can give you this pass to use once as an excuse to get out of bed for a specific reason. For example, your child might ask to go to the bathroom, for one last hug, or a glass of water. Using a bedtime pass can limit the endless excuses that your toddler wants to get out of bed.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin-top: 0;" id="ch4">Do's and Don’ts of Moving to a Toddler Bed</h2>
<p>
    When <a href="https://lambsivy.com/blogs/news/crib-sheet-material">moving from a crib</a> to a toddler bed, there are a few important dos and don’ts. Here’s what parents should know.
</p>
<p><strong>Do:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Communicate with your child about the change.</li>
    <li>Involve your child in the changes to their room.</li>
    <li>Provide emotional support. </li>
    <li>Child-proof your little one’s bedroom.</li>
    <li>Wait for signs of readiness.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don’t:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Make this change when other major changes are happening in your child’s life, such as starting daycare or preschool.</li>
    <li>Transition your child out of a crib before they are ready. Your child should be at least 18 months old to <a href="https://lambsivy.com/blogs/news/safe-sleep-for-babies-guide">ensure safe sleep</a>.  </li>
    <li>Allow your child to change bedtime routines. With their newfound ability to get out of bed anytime they want, they may try to wear you down and delay bedtime. Return your child to bed calmly each time. Eventually, your child will adjust to their new toddler bed. </li>
    <li>Don’t give your child a pillow before age 2. </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin-top: 0;" id="ch5">FAQs on Transitioning to a Toddler Bed</h2>
<p>Still have questions? Here are a few important FAQs about how to transition to a toddler bed. </p>

<h3>What age should a child be out of a crib?</h3>
<p>
    Most children are out of their crib and sleeping in a toddler bed or twin-sized bed by the time they are 3 years old. However, the exact age depends on the child. If the crib rail is at your child’s chest, that’s another sign to make the transition, as your child may be able to climb out of the crib. 
</p>

<h3>How do I make the crib to toddler bed transition smoother? </h3>
<p>
    You can make the crib to toddler bed transition smoother by involving your child. Tell them about the change ahead of time and invite them to help set up the toddler bed with new bedding. You might even have your toddler pick out their favorite new design! 
</p>

<h3>How do I know if my toddler is ready for a toddler bed?</h3>
<p>
    Your toddler may show some signs that they’re ready for a toddler bed. Some signs include climbing out of their crib, expressing interest in a toddler bed, and showing maturity. Another sign is that your child is too big for their crib. 
</p>

<h3>How young is too young for a toddler bed?</h3>
<p>
    Experts at the <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/from-crib-to-toddler-bed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Cleveland Clinic</a> recommend moving your baby to a toddler bed between 18 months and 3 years of age. Younger than 18 months may be too young to transition to a toddler bed, as your child still needs a firm mattress and safe sleep environment.
