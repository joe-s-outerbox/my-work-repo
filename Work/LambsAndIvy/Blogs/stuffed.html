    Watching your little one carry their favorite plushie around, pretending to feed them or put them to bed is adorable. <strong>Yet, <a href="https://lambsivy.com/collections/plush">plush toys</a> are much more than entertainment. They also support children’s emotional, physical, social, and cognitive growth.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As a mom of three, I’ve seen my children flourish while playing with stuffed animals. My daughter has even made <a href="https://lambsivy.com/collections/baby-toys">toys and accessories</a> for her stuffed animals. <em>I’ve also noticed that all three of my children also practice empathy while caring for their favorite plushies. </em>
</p>
<p>
    What other advantages can kids gain from these cute toys? Read on to learn more about the benefits of stuffed animals for children.
</p>
<h2 id="ch1">Emotional Benefits of Stuffed Animals</h2>
<p>
    Why do kids love <a href="https://lambsivy.com/collections/plush">stuffed animals</a>? One of the main reasons is the emotional support they provide. 
</p>
<h3>1. Comfort and Security</h3>
<p>
    When your child is upset or scared, a plush toy can provide comfort. <strong>In psychology, stuffed animals are called “transitional objects.”</strong> These inanimate objects comfort children, especially during new or distressing situations, <a href="https://icjs.us/the-positives-of-plushies-stuffed-animals-have-benefits-for-children-and-adults/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">experts say</a>. 
</p>
<p>
    Plus, stuffed animals help children (and adults) relax. Sleep psychologist, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/adults-who-sleep-with-stuffed-animals/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jade Wu, explained to the New York Times</a> that stuffed animals can help you self-soothe. This in turn helps your child relax and fall asleep. 
</p>

<h3>2. Emotional Regulation</h3>
<p>
    As a comforting presence, <a href="https://lambsivy.com/collections/plush">stuffed animals</a> can help children manage their emotions or relieve anxiety. For example, a plush toy might make a scary visit to the doctor or dentist a little easier. <strong><a href="https://icjs.us/the-positives-of-plushies-stuffed-animals-have-benefits-for-children-and-adults/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Studies</a> even show that providing children undergoing surgery with a stuffed animal can reduce their reported pain.</strong> Also, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/before-during-after-shots/less-stress.html#:~:text=6.,into%20the%20room%20with%20you." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the CDC</a> recommends bringing a favorite toy like a stuffed animal to help your child through vaccinations. 
</p>
<h3>3. Supporting Independence</h3>
<p>
    <strong>One of the benefits of sleeping with a plush toy is that it promotes independence.</strong> At bedtime, children may feel scared of the dark or vulnerable. Taking a plushie to bed can help them fall asleep independently. 
</p>
<p>
    My own children have often taken a stuffed animal with them to the bathroom when they were otherwise too scared to go alone. 
</p>
<h2 id="ch2">Cognitive Benefits of Stuffed Animals</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://lambsivy.com/collections/plush">Plushies</a> can also benefit children’s cognitive development. They inspire all kinds of exciting play that stimulates their creativity. 
</p>
<h3>1. Imagination and Creativity</h3>
<p>
    Stuffed animals are perfect companions for pretend play. While playing, children develop their imaginations and creativity. Plus, children create situations that require problem-solving skills. One common play scenario my children enjoy is that their plush toys are sick and need the attention of a doctor. Or, they might pretend to cook a meal for their stuffed animals. 
</p>
<p>
    During pretend play, your child might run into real-life problems to solve, such as how to build a fort, how to make clothes for the stuffed animals, or who will play which role. 
</p>
<h3>2. Cognitive Development and Language Skills</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
    <strong>Pretend play is important for developing vocabulary, <a href="https://blogs.iu.edu/earlyliteracy/2024/05/03/the-hidden-power-of-pretend-play/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Indiana University says</a>.</strong> Plus, children develop other literacy skills like creating a story with a plot, conflict, and resolution. Other skills include oral communication skills, body language and gestures, and expressing emotions.

<h2 id="ch3" style="margin-top: 0;">Developmental Benefits of Stuffed Animals</h2>
<p>
    For babies and young children, stuffed animals also help children build other developmental skills. 
</p>
<h3>1. Motor Skills</h3>
<p>
    Babies love plushies. Why do babies like plushies? Young babies <a href="https://lambsivy.com/collections/baby-toys">love stuffed animals</a> because they’re light enough for them to easily hold. When babies are about 3 months old, they can start grasping and holding onto small plushies, building their hand muscles.
</p>
<p>
    Older children can benefit, too. My daughter loves making clothing for her stuffed animals. As she does, she builds her fine motor skills by sewing, cutting, and drawing. Many children also pretend to feed their plushies, which also helps build hand-eye coordination. 
</p>
<h3>2. Object Permanence </h3>
<p>
    You can use a stuffed animal or other <a href="https://lambsivy.com/collections/baby-toys">baby toys</a> to teach your baby object permanence. This means your baby needs to learn that objects still exist when not in sight. This is why games of peek-a-boo are so fun for your baby. You can also hide their favorite plushie under a pillow or blanket and encourage them to find it. This game is ideal for babies between 6 and 12 months of age. 
</p>
<h2 id="ch4">Social Benefits of Stuffed Animals</h2>
<p>
    Another benefit of stuffed animals is that they help build social skills. Here’s how.
</p>
<h3>1. Social Skills and Empathy</h3>
<p>
    When playing with plushies, children practice social interactions such as going to the doctor, meeting a new friend, or pretending to eat at a restaurant. Playing out these scenarios helps children develop essential life skills. When playing with several stuffed animals, your child may imagine and play out conversations between them. 
</p>
<p>
    Plus, through pretend play, children develop empathy, the <a href="https://blogs.iu.edu/earlyliteracy/2024/05/03/the-hidden-power-of-pretend-play/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">University of Indiana asserts</a>. Children learn to imagine other people’s feelings by caring for their stuffed animals. For example, they might imagine that their plushie is scared when they take them to the doctor. Or, they might imagine that they’re angry when fighting with another plushie over a toy. 
</p>
<h3>2. Responsibility</h3>
<p>
    Taking care of a stuffed animal helps children develop a sense of responsibility. My daughter often carries around her favorite plushie in a bag and always remembers to show it exciting things while we’re out on a walk. She might even put a scarf on her plushie if it’s cold outside. While it may seem trivial, these small actions show that she is taking responsibility for her animal. This can translate to caring for a pet, friends, and family members.
