        <h2>What Is the Difference Between Floor Liners and Floor Mats?</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-u7hwmi03lp/images/stencil/original/image-manager/custom-fit-floor-liners.jpg?t=1708113544" alt="custom fit floor liners">
        <p>Floor liners and floor mats are similar in many ways, but what makes them stand apart from one another is their design, functionality, and price point:
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Floor liners</strong> are custom-designed protective coverings engineered to match the exact contours of a vehicle’s floor area. Tailor-made for specific makes and models, they seamlessly fit the vehicle flooring to provide all-encompassing protection against spills and debris. The specialized design of floor liners typically makes them more expensive than universal options.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section grey-bg" style="background-color: #F2F2F5;">
        <p><strong>At BaseLayer, we primarily manufacture custom-fit floor liners for popular name brand vehicles including <a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/floor-liners/ford/">Ford</a>, <a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/car-floor-mats-liners/chevrolet-floor-mats-liners/">Chevy</a>, <a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/car-floor-mats-liners/gmc-floor-mats-liners/">GMC</a>, <a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/car-floor-mats-liners/toyota-floor-mats-liners/">Toyota</a>, <a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/car-floor-mats-liners/lexus-floor-mats-liners/">Lexus</a>, <a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/floor-liners/honda/">Honda</a>, and <a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/car-mats-floor-liners/jeep/">Jeep</a>.</strong> Our floor liners boast a premium surface texture with contoured edges, effectively trapping snow, water, and dirt.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Floor mats</strong> offer similar levels of protection as liners but are not custom-made for specific vehicles. They are a more versatile protective covering designed to fit a wide range of makes and models. Car floor mats are often more budget-friendly than custom-fit alternatives.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section grey-bg" style="background-color: #F2F2F5;">
        <p><strong>At BaseLayer, we manufacture <a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/car-mats-floor-liners/universal/">universal floor mats</a> to cater to the vehicles that do not have specific liner models available.</strong> Our floor mats are designed with stylized reservoirs that channel water and debris away from your vehicle's carpet. While they may not offer the same precise fit as floor liners, they are designed to be trimmed and adjusted to your vehicle to provide significant protection against common floor hazards.</p>
        <p>Despite these differences between floor liners and floor mats, many tend to use the terms interchangeably (<em>which we’ve been guilty of ourselves</em>). So if you reach out to BaseLayer asking for a custom-fit floor mat or a Universal floor liner, we’ll know what you’re talking about!

        <h2>What Are the Similarities Between Floor Liners and Floor Mats?</h2>
        <p>Although they differ in various ways, floor liners and floor mats can share several key characteristics depending on the manufacturer. At BaseLayer, we utilize quality materials and innovative processes to develop our products. As a result, our selection of floor liners and floor mats have many similarities to one another:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crafted With High-Quality Materials:</strong> BaseLayer floor liners and floor mats are both made with eco-friendly, automotive grade Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPE) for enhanced longevity. Additionally, all of our floor coverings are odorless and 100% recyclable.</li>
