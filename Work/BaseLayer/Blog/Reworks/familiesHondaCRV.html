		<p>
            When it comes to the Midsize Crossover SUV, there are few that have the overall level of popularity that the Honda CR-V has. There are a bunch of these on the market, and if you google ‘Midsize Crossover SUV’ or ‘CUV’ you will see more than a dozen vehicles that bill themselves as such. But none have the staying power that the Honda CR-V has. Now the question is: why? Why does this SUV stand out from the crowd? Well that’s the question we are here to answer!

		<h2>3 Reasons Why the Honda CR-V is Perfect for Families</h2>
		<p>
            Our team could spend hours talking about the performance of the CR-V but we don’t want to get too technical. We could discuss its spacious leg room and storage capacity, but those aren’t the main traits that make it a great vehicle (although they are nice to have). At the end of the day, there are 3 factors that truly make the CR-V a perfect fit for families:
		</p>
		<h3>Fuel Economy</h3>
		<p>
            We know we said that we wouldn’t be getting technical, but with gas prices increasing on an every other day basis, this is an important part. Gas is a major expense for families, especially ones that have kids in sports (which is a CR-V specialty), and the CR-V does a great job of conserving gas without sacrificing performance.
		</p>
		<h3>Aggressive Styling</h3>
		<p>
            While we are sitting back and worrying about gas mileage, we still want to look cool, and that is another thing that the CR-V does well. With aggressive styling that counters its competitors, the Honda CR-V is where you go when you want to see what rugged looks like when matched up with luxury. It is a showstopper to be sure.
		</p>
		<h3>Reliability Is King</h3>
		<p>
            They say it all the time in sports: 
			<em>“the greatest ability is availability.”</em> The Honda CR-V certainly embodies this ideal. Throughout its run, the CR-V has had an absurdly low amount of complaints lodged against it. Since the redesign of the CR-V in 2017, there has not been a crossover SUV with less Registered Complaints.
