<p style="text-align: center;">
	<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to keeping your car smelling fresh and new, there are some really simple tips to keep in mind. Follow this list, and you will have a great smelling ride in no time at all.&nbsp;</span>

<ul>
	<li><strong>No Smoking</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Cigarette smoke not only dirties up your windows, but the smell seeps into fabrics. Smoking in your car is a sure fire way to have your ride smelling like a rolling ashtray. Besides just being unhealthy for you, here is one more reason to put down that cigarette, and get on the road to a healthier, better smelling life.</span></li>

	<li><strong>Keep Your Car Interior Dry</strong> - One thing that water and other liquids are great for is keeping you hydrated. One thing they are not great for is keeping your car smelling like the day you bought it. The moisture can get deep into fabrics and cause mold and mildew growth. We’ve all pulled that load out of the washer that's been sitting for a day, and we know you don’t want the inside of your car, truck, or SUV smelling like that for the whole ride. A set of <a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/car-mats-floor-liners/" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">custom fit floor mats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from BaseLayer can help with this, as the moisture will not get absorbed when it hits your floor, and is easily cleaned up.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hang That Air Freshener</strong> - Easily the simplest thing you can do to keep your car fresh is to hang one of those $1.50 air fresheners and spruce the scent up a bit. Obviously you can pick any scent, but there is just something about that New Car scent that seems to be everyone's favorite.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Vacuum, Vacuum, Vacuum</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - Even with a set of amazing </span><a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/car-mats-floor-liners/" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">custom fit floor liners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from BaseLayer, you still probably have fabric seats and you certainly have carpet throughout the vehicle. Vacuuming up the debris from your seats and stuff that falls on the floor is step 1 or 1a to getting your car smelling like new again. I know we put this at 4, but this list is not in exact order so…&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
