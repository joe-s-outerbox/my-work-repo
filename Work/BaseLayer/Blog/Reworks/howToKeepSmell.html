            One of the best things about getting a new car is that new car smell. One of the worst things though is that smell doesn’t last long, and seems to be almost impossible to get back. Now… we said it was <em>almost</em> impossible. That’s because besides providing you with the top quality option for aftermarket custom fit floor liners available, we also know a thing or two about cars, trucks, and SUV’s. One of those things is how to keep your car smelling like new, and how to get it back to smelling like new if you’ve lost it. Take a second and read through our tips on how to keep your new car smell for as long as you want.

	<p>
        When it comes to keeping your car smelling fresh and new, there are some really simple tips to keep in mind. Follow this list, and you will have a great smelling ride in no time at all.
	</p>
	<h3>No Smoking</h3>
	<p>
        Cigarette smoke not only dirties up your windows, but the smell seeps into fabrics. Smoking in your car is a sure fire way to have your ride smelling like a rolling ashtray. Besides just being unhealthy for you, here is one more reason to put down that cigarette, and get on the road to a healthier, better smelling life.
	</p>
	<h3>Keep Your Car Interior Dry</h3>
	<p>
        One thing that water and other liquids are great for is keeping you hydrated. One thing they are not great for is keeping your car smelling like the day you bought it. The moisture can get deep into fabrics and cause mold and mildew growth. We’ve all pulled that load out of the washer that's been sitting for a day, and we know you don’t want the inside of your car, truck, or SUV smelling like that for the whole ride. A set of 
		<a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/floor-mats/">custom-fit floor liners</a> or <a href="https://baselayerlabs.com/floor-mats/universal-floor-mats/">universal floor mats</a> can help with this, as the moisture will not get absorbed when it hits your floor, and is easily cleaned up.
	</p>
	<h3>Hang That Air Freshener</h3>
	<p>
        Easily the simplest thing you can do to keep your car fresh is to hang one of those $1.50 air fresheners and spruce the scent up a bit. Obviously you can pick any scent, but there is just something about that New Car scent that seems to be everyone's favorite.
	</p>
	<h3>Vacuum, Vacuum, Vacuum</h3>
	<p>
        Even with a set of high quality floor coverings, you still probably have fabric seats and you certainly have carpet throughout the vehicle. Vacuuming up the debris from your seats and stuff that falls on the floor is step 1 or 1a to getting your car smelling like new again. I know we put this at 4, but this list is not in exact order so…
	</p>
	<h3>Clean Your Floor Mats</h3>
	<p>
        Investing in quality floor coverings is important for keeping your interior clean, but keeping those coverings clean is just as important. It not only helps with the smell of your ride but it improves the aesthetics as well! And with BaseLayer floor mats and liners (made from Thermoplastic Elastomers), cleaning the gunk off is much easier to do than with the fabric mats that came with your vehicle. Our mats can be easily removed from your vehicle and hosed off, whereas a fabric mat will require shampooing in order to be cleaned properly (not to mention all the hours they’ll need to hang and dry outside before you can put them back in).
