        <p>
            One of the most popular activities for motorsports enthusiasts with off-road vehicles is something called “mudding”, and if you don’t know what that is then let us help you understand. Mudding your vehicle is when you take your ride through some crazy off-road conditions that will leave it caked in mud from bumper to bumper. Speaking from personal experience, going out mudding can be a lot of fun. But depending on where you live, the terrain at your disposal may leave a lot to be desired.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your off-roading conditions are less than ideal, here’s a word of advice: head west. In addition to having beautiful scenic views, the west coast is home to some of the best mudding spots in the US! Here are some of our favorite spots to go off-roading.

	<h3>Moab, Utah</h3>

	<p>
        This is one of the most beautiful places on the planet, which also makes it one of the busiest for those that come to take advantage of the OHV (Off Highway Vehicle) trails that are a part of what makes Moab so cool. From the red rock formations to the expertly crafted trails, there is something for everyone here in Moab, Utah. Want to plan a trip? Check out 
		<a href="https://www.discovermoab.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Discover Moab</a> to find out when people will be there, and where they are going to be. Also, if you are planning to come into Moab to enjoy the trails, you will need to have completed the <a href="https://recreation.utah.gov/off-highway-vehicles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">OHV course through the Utah DNR</a>.

	<h3>South Lake Tahoe, California</h3>

	<p>
        We know, Lake Tahoe doesn’t stick out as a mudding or off road Mecca. That is until you realize this is where the legendary Rubicon Trail is located. You know the Rubicon Trail? Jeep named a Wrangler after it because of how challenging it is for vehicle and driver alike. You are advised to expect that your ride is going to be damaged if you attempt to complete the Rubicon Trail. It is iconic, and completely worth the trip to come and experience it. If you want to plan a trip to the Rubicon Trail then

	<p>
        This little gem is where you will find the Hollister Hills SVRA, or State Recreational Vehicle Area. This spot is operated by the OHMVR Division of California State Parks. It is in fact one of nine OHV parks operated by California and designed to let you test your ride's metal against the best that Mother Nature can throw at it. Check out the 
		<a href="https://ohv.parks.ca.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">OHMVR website</a> to see which of the nine sports are currently open (some have been closed due to the threat of wildfires).
