                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Smoke bombs for gender reveal are designed to provide an exciting visual effect while minimizing messiness. However, it's important to note that the smoke emitted from the smoke bombs can leave a residue on surfaces, particularly if used in close proximity to them. We recommend conducting the gender reveal outdoors or in areas where cleaning up any minor residue is more convenient. It's always a good idea to have a damp cloth or some cleaning supplies on hand to quickly address any residual traces.</p>
