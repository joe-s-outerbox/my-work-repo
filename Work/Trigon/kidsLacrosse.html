    <h2>How To Start Lacrosse</h2>
    
    <p>
        A lot of parents struggle with where to start once your child expresses an interest in playing a particular sport. Lacrosse is no different and may be even harder to get started in because it isn't as common as youth baseball, basketball or football. Lacrosse for kids, though, has exploded in popularity in the last decade, and youth leagues can be found in many major cities, suburbs and small towns.

    <p>
        The best way to get started with kids lacrosse is to find a local sports league. An internet search should be able to tell you whether lacrosse for kids is available in your area. You can also contact your town's parks and recreation department; they are the most likely organization to run a kids lacrosse league. Even if they do not currently have a league in operation, they may be able to point you in the direction of a nearby town or city that has lacrosse for kids. If push comes to shove, you could organize your own league provided you have enough interested participants.

    <h2>What Do You Need For Lacrosse?</h2>
    
    <p>In order to play a game of lacrosse, there are a few things you will need to get started. While some of this equipment is optional, if you are interested in organizing lacrosse for kids that is fun, healthy, safe and representative of the professional version of the game, you will need the following:</p>
    
    <div class="list-container">
        <ul>
            <li>Enough Players (Depending On Age Level)</li>
            <li>Youth Lacrosse Equipment For Safety</li>
            <li>An Appropriately-Sized Field</li>
            <li>Two Goals</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

        That last one is optional, but it's always a good idea to keep the parents comfortable and to provide a place for the athletes to sit when they are not in the game.

    <h2>What Is Considered Basic Youth Lacrosse Equipment?</h2>
    
    <p>
        There are a few differences in the kinds of required equipment between boys and girls lacrosse. The major ones involve headgear: In boys lacrosse, kids are required to wear helmets with facemasks; girls are only required to wear goggles. Kids lacrosse gear requires gloves, sticks, shin guards, mouthguards, cleats or turf shoes (depending on the playing surface) and balls. Boys lacrosse additionally requires shoulder pads and arm pads. Kids lacrosse gear is important to keep children safe and to prevent injury during play.
