            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Benefits of Becoming a Notary Public in Dayton, Ohio</h2>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Some people decide to become a notary public because they want a side job to
                bring in a little extra income. Others &ndash; particularly those who work in banks or financial
                institutions &ndash; pursue their notary commission to use on the job. Curtailing identity theft and
                fraud for companies is a crucial function, and having a notary commission gives you an advantage over
                other candidates applying for the same position. Whatever your motivation, becoming a notary public in
                Dayton, Ohio, is a worthy pursuit.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Responsibilities of a Notary Public</h2>

        <p>A notary public is a citizen with the authority to certify signatures on legal documents. By acting as an
            unbiased witness, a notary helps prevent fraudulent signatures on mortgages, wills, powers of attorney and
            other legal documents.</p>

        <p>As a notary public in Dayton, Ohio, it's your job to ensure the people who sign documents are who they say
            they are. You'll also be responsible for checking that the signer isn't being forced or intimidated into
            signing a document &mdash; and that they understand what they are signing. You may need to put the person
            under oath before they sign the document and have them declare, under penalty of perjury, that the
            information they've given you is correct.</p>
