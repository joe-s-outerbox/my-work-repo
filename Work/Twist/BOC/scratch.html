    <li><strong>Infusion of Wabi-Sabi and Yin-Yang Philosophies:</strong> Wabi-sabi, rooted in Japanese Zen Buddhism, celebrates the beauty in imperfection, impermanence and simplicity, encouraging an appreciation for the flawed and transient aspects of life. Yin-yang, originating from ancient Chinese philosophy, represents the concept of dualism, illustrating how contrary forces may be complementary and interdependent in the natural world, balancing each other in a harmonious system.</li>
    <li><strong>Toi-et-moi:</strong> This jewelry term – French for "you and me" – refers to two gemstones set side by side or close to each other. The two stones often differ in size, shape or color, symbolizing the union of two unique individuals coming together in a relationship.</li>
