                            “I had such a great experience at White of Dublin. Unlike some other salons I went to, I didn’t feel like the saleswomen were trying to push dresses on me or tell me that every single one was the most special thing they have ever seen. They gave me honest feedback, listened to what I wanted to and negotiated pricing with me!”

                            “This was such an amazing experience! I was searching for a place that would give me an experience similar to what you see in the movies/tv. White of Dublin exceeded it! Miranda was above and beyond amazing. Words cannot describe how awesome she is at her job. My whole party who joined me felt the same way. I will recommend White of Dublin to anyone I know that is searching for the perfect wedding dress!”
