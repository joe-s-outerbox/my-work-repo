            <h3>Bariatric Surgery Options</h3>
            <p>Our surgical weight loss solutions include:</p>

            <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/gastric-sleeve-vsg/">Gastric Sleeve (VSG) Surgery</a>
            <p>
                During this weight loss surgery, we remove a portion of the stomach to create a smaller, sleeve-shaped organ
                that will hold less food. This reduction in stomach size helps decrease hunger and food intake, aiding
                weight loss. Unlike other bariatric surgeries, this procedure does not reroute the intestines, making it a
                simpler option for those looking to lose weight surgically.
            </p>

            <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/lap-band/">Lap Band Surgery</a>
            <p>
                Also known as adjustable gastric banding, Lap Band surgery is a minimally invasive procedure that surrounds
                the upper stomach with a silicone band to create a smaller stomach pouch. The reduced capacity leads to
                earlier satiety with less food, promoting sustainable weight loss.
            </p>

            <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/gastric-bypass-surgery/">Gastric Bypass</a>
            <p>
                Gastric bypass surgery, also called Roux-en-Y, is a two-step weight loss operation that decreases stomach
                size and modifies the digestive tract to restrict food intake and nutrient absorption.
            </p>

            <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/sadi-surgery/">SADI Surgery</a>
            <p>
                SADI surgery is a streamlined version of the duodenal switch that creates a single connection between the
                stomach and the small intestine, shortening the nutrient-absorbing intestine to reduce calorie intake and
                enhance weight loss. This method promotes significant, sustainable weight loss while lowering the risk of
                complications common in more complex bariatric surgeries.
            </p>

            <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/weight-loss-surgery-revisions/gastric-band-revision/">Gastric Band
                Revision</a>
            <p>
                Once the most popular weight loss surgery worldwide, gastric bands can often be revised into a gastric
                bypass or sleeve or SADI procedure.
            </p>

            <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/weight-loss-surgery-revisions/gastric-sleeve-revision/">Gastric Sleeve
                Revision</a>
            <p>
                If you're seeking improved outcomes or experiencing issues after gastric sleeve surgery, a VSG revision can
                adjust your initial procedure. Known for its simplicity and efficiency, gastric sleeve revision has a low
                complication rate and delivers significant results.
            </p>

            <p>
                The ideal candidate for each weight loss surgery varies. Our experienced team can guide you through the
                decision-making process and answer questions along the way.
