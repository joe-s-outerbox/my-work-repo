    <h2>Weight Loss Surgery for Kentucky Residents</h2>
    <p>If you want weight loss surgery in Kentucky, our cutting-edge surgery center is just over the Ohio River in Cincinnati. <strong>In close collaboration with you, our expert medical team will determine the best surgical approach to help you achieve lasting, significant results.</strong> Our surgical weight loss options include:</p>
    <h3>Gastric Sleeve</h3>
    <p>Also called a <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/gastric-sleeve-vsg/">sleeve gastrectomy</a>, this procedure minimizes the size of your stomach by eliminating a portion and creating a sleeve-shaped organ. Reducing the amount of food you can eat, this treatment promotes effective long-term weight loss by allowing you to feel full sooner.</p>
    <h3>Lap Band</h3>
    <p>A <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/lap-band/">lap band</a> procedure involves putting an adjustable band around your upper stomach. By slowing digestion and reducing food intake, this helps you eat less and lose weight. As time passes, the band can be adjusted to deliver optimal results.</p>
    <h3>Gastric Bypass</h3>
    <p>During <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/gastric-bypass-surgery/">gastric bypass surgery</a>, a small stomach pouch is created, and part of your small intestine is rerouted. Reducing how much food you can eat, this procedure decreases calorie absorption and leads to significant weight loss.</p>
    <h3>SADI Surgery</h3>
    <p>A single anastomosis duodenal-ileal (<a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/sadi-surgery/">SADI</a>) bypass with sleeve gastrectomy is a newer procedure. It combines the characteristics of gastric bypass and gastric sleeve by bypassing a portion of your small intestine and creating a sleeve-shaped stomach. This approach promotes better metabolic health and generates substantial weight loss.</p>
    <h3>Gastric Band Revision</h3>
    <p>A <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/weight-loss-surgery-revisions/gastric-band-revision/">gastric band revision</a> is for patients suffering from insufficient weight loss or complications from lap band surgery. This procedure removes or adjusts the gastric band, improving outcomes and resolving issues.</p>
    <h3>Gastric Sleeve Revision</h3>
    <p>Those facing complications or weight regain after a gastric sleeve procedure may require <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/weight-loss-surgery-revisions/gastric-sleeve-revision/">gastric sleeve revision surgery</a>.  This additional procedure can address any issues and help you begin losing weight again.</p>

    <h2>Non-Surgical Weight Loss Options</h2>
    <p>We know surgery might not be appropriate for everyone, so we offer the gastric balloon procedure. This is a temporary, non-surgical weight loss option that puts a soft, expandable balloon in your stomach. The balloon helps you feel full sooner and eat less because it takes up space in your stomach.</p>
    <p>No incisions are necessary because the <a href="https://journeylite.com/weight-loss-medications/gastric-balloon-surgery/">gastric balloon procedure</a> is performed endoscopically. Our medical experts provide comprehensive support and guidance during the six months the balloon is in place so you can develop healthy eating habits and realize your weight loss goals.</p>
