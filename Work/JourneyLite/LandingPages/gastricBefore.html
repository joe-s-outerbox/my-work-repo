        <p class="ba-name"><strong>Amanda Bowman</strong></p>
        
            <p>
                <strong>My highest adult weight was (lbs):</strong> 400<br>
                <strong>My current weight is (lbs):</strong> 250
            </p>
            <strong>Tell us how surgery has helped you get control of your weight issues:</strong> <p>It has been the most life-changing experience of my adult life. I feel like I have a life again, and my only regret is that I didn't have the surgery sooner! I have lost 150 pounds and am still losing weight. My diabetes and pulmonary hypertension have completely resolved and are gone. I am off all of the medications for those diagnoses. My energy level is through the roof! I can do things that I haven't been able to do in years, and I can be the wife, mother, daughter, and friend that I want to be to those that I love.</p>
            <strong>Tell us about the support you have received from the team at JourneyLite and how it has impacted your success:</strong><p>My biggest struggle to overcome was fear before the surgery. On the day of my surgery, everyone was so reassuring and kind. When Dr. Augusta came in to see me before surgery, I told him that I had prayed for him that morning. He smiled and told me that he had prayed for me too. As a person of faith, that really comforted me and made me feel a sense of calm. I'm so grateful for the entire team!</p>

            </p>
            <strong>Tell us how surgery has helped you get control of your weight issues:</strong> <p>I believe my main issue was that I was a binge eater. I had an addiction to food. With the gastric sleeve tool, that issue was resolved. I am now completely satisfied with small portions and I am content with the foods I choose to eat. I found my love for dance and sports to maintain an active lifestyle, and I feel confident enough to dance or play on playgrounds everywhere I go.</p>
            <strong>Tell us about the support you have received from the team at JourneyLite and how it has impacted your success:</strong><p> JourneyLite provided me with all the different options available and helped me to decide which one was right for me. I felt at ease having all the risks and details associated with the procedure as well as the diet education. … Post-surgery check-ups and other resources they provide have helped me maintain my results for over 6 years now. I lost 190 pounds and have kept it off! My loose skin is slowly shrinking, and I am in the best shape of my life at almost 40 years old. I have more energy than most teenagers I know, lol. I now feel like I can shine instead of hiding myself in a corner.</p>

            <strong>Tell us how surgery has helped you get control of your weight issues:</strong> <p>Since having the gastric sleeve, my activity level, relationships, and self-confidence have increased greatly.</p>
            <p>Having a smaller stomach capacity has allowed me to gain greater control over my emotional eating. When I wanted to binge and self-sabotage, I could not do so without feeling ill. It forced me to think about the choices I was making in that moment and how they were affecting my body. Over time, it helped me to begin to see greater successes and to know that one bad decision doesn’t need to result in quitting.</p>
            <p> I no longer require external validation to see my self-worth and feel confident in who I am on the inside and the outside. I have discovered a version of myself that I never knew existed and did not know could exist. Instead of watching television, you can find me at the gym, working in the yard, or playing racquetball with my husband.</p>

        <h2>What Is Gastric Sleeve Surgery?</h2>

        <p><strong>Also called a sleeve gastrectomy, <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/gastric-sleeve-vsg/">gastric sleeve surgery</a> is a minimally invasive procedure during which the surgeon creates a smaller, sleeve-shaped stomach by removing a portion of the stomach.</strong> The surgery significantly decreases the amount of food the stomach can hold, helping patients feel full sooner and consume fewer calories. It is performed laparoscopically, involving small incisions and a camera for guidance, resulting in a quicker recovery time and less postoperative discomfort.</p>
        <h2>Gastric Sleeve Timeline: What to Expect</h2>
        <p>No two patients are the same, and individual results can vary widely. However, after performing thousands of gastric sleeve surgeries, JourneyLite surgeons have identified common patterns in patient progress at different intervals. Here’s a general guideline:</p>

        <p class="ba-name"><strong>3 Months After Surgery</strong></p>
        <p>At three months post-surgery, patients at JourneyLite often see significant progress in their weight loss journey. Here's what you can expect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weight Loss: Many patients lose about 30% of their excess weight.</li>
            <li>Diet: You will transition from pureed and soft foods to more solid foods. Portion sizes will still be small.</li>
            <li>Activity Level: Moderate physical activities such as walking or swimming are recommended. Increased energy levels allow for more participation in daily activities.</li>
            <li>Health Improvements: Many patients report reduced symptoms of conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ba-name"><strong>6 Months After Surgery</strong></p>
        <p>At six months, the changes become more noticeable, and the weight loss journey continues to be rewarding.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weight Loss: Patients often lose 50-60% of their excess weight.</li>
            <li>Diet: Your diet will include a variety of healthy solid foods. It is important to follow nutritional guidelines to avoid deficiencies.</li>
            <li>Activity Level: You can gradually increase the intensity of your workouts. Strength training can be incorporated to build muscle mass.</li>
            <li>Health Improvements: Continued improvement in chronic conditions. Increased mobility and decreased joint pain are common.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ba-name"><strong>9 Months After Surgery</strong></p>
        <p>At nine months, significant physical and emotional changes are evident.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weight Loss: Patients often lose 50-60% of their excess weight.</li>
            <li>Diet: Your diet will include a variety of healthy solid foods. It is important to follow nutritional guidelines to avoid deficiencies.</li>
            <li>Activity Level: You can gradually increase the intensity of your workouts. Strength training can be incorporated to build muscle mass.</li>
            <li>Health Improvements: Continued improvement in chronic conditions. Increased mobility and decreased joint pain are common.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ba-name"><strong>One Year After Surgery</strong></p>
        <p>One year post-surgery marks a major milestone with substantial weight loss and lifestyle changes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weight Loss: Many patients reach their goal weight, having lost 70-80% of their excess weight.</li>
            <li>Diet: Your diet should be well-established with a focus on long-term healthy eating habits. Regular follow-ups with a nutritionist can help.</li>
            <li>Activity Level: High levels of physical activity are encouraged. Many patients participate in sports or fitness programs.</li>
            <li>Health Improvements: Significant improvements or resolution of obesity-related conditions. Enhanced quality of life and psychological well-being.</li>
        </ul>
