    <h2>Surgical Services at Our Cincinnati Weight Loss Clinic</h2>
    <p>At our main office and surgery center in Cincinnati, JourneyLite offers a comprehensive range of weight loss options to help you achieve significant and lasting results. <strong>Our expert team of surgeons and medical professionals will work with you to determine the best surgical approach for your individual needs and goals.</strong> Here are the surgical weight loss services we provide:</p>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Gastric Sleeve</h3>
    <p>Also known as <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/gastric-sleeve-vsg/">sleeve gastrectomy</a>, this treatment reduces the size of the stomach by removing a portion to create a sleeve-shaped organ. The procedure decreases the amount of food you can eat, allowing you to feel full sooner, and promoting effective long-term weight loss.</p>
    <h3>Lap Band</h3>
    <p>During a <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/lap-band/">lap band</a> procedure, we create a small pouch by placing an adjustable band around your upper stomach. This reduces food intake and slows digestion, helping you to eat less and lose weight. The band can be adjusted over time to ensure optimal results.</p>
    <h3>Gastric Bypass</h3>
    <p>In <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/gastric-bypass-surgery/">gastric bypass surgery</a>, we reroute a section of the small intestine and create a small stomach pouch. This lowers the amount of food you can eat and decreases calorie absorption, leading to significant weight loss.</p>
    <h3>SADI Surgery</h3>
    <p>A single anastomosis duodenal-ileal (<a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/sadi-surgery/">SADI</a>) bypass with sleeve gastrectomy is a newer procedure that combines aspects of the gastric sleeve and gastric bypass. It involves creating a sleeve-shaped stomach and bypassing a portion of the small intestine. This dual approach promotes substantial weight loss and improved metabolic health.</p>
    <h3>Gastric Band Revision</h3>
    <p>For patients who experience complications from lap band surgery or insufficient weight loss, we offer <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/weight-loss-surgery-revisions/gastric-band-revision/">gastric band revision</a>. This procedure involves adjusting or removing the gastric band to address issues and improve outcomes.</p>
    <h3>Gastric Sleeve Revision</h3>
    <p>If you have had a gastric sleeve procedure and are facing weight regain or complications, our <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/weight-loss-surgery-revisions/gastric-sleeve-revision/">gastric sleeve revision surgery</a> can help. This additional surgery addresses any issues and helps you get back on track with your weight loss journey.</p>

    <p>At our Cincinnati weight loss clinic, we provide the most advanced surgical techniques and the highest standards of care to help you realize your weight loss goals. Our team supports you through every step, from the initial consultation to post-surgery follow-up and beyond.</p>

    <h2>Non-Surgical Options and Weight Loss Injections in Ohio</h2>
    <p>We understand that surgical weight loss solutions may not be the right fit for everyone. That's why <strong>we offer a variety of non-surgical services to help you achieve your wellness and health goals.</strong> Our non-surgical options are effective, safe, and designed to meet your individual needs.</p>
    <h3>Gastric Balloon Procedure</h3>
    <p>This is a temporary, non-surgical weight loss option that involves placing a soft, expandable balloon in your stomach. This balloon takes up space in your stomach, helping you feel full sooner and eat less. We perform the <a href="https://journeylite.com/weight-loss-medications/gastric-balloon-surgery/">gastric balloon procedure</a> endoscopically, meaning no incisions are required, and it typically takes about 20 to 30 minutes. The balloon is left in place for six months, during which time you will receive comprehensive support and guidance from our team so you can realize your weight loss goals and develop healthy eating habits.</p>
    <h3>Weight Loss Medications (Prescription and Injections)</h3>
    <p>For those seeking a pharmaceutical approach to weight loss, JourneyLite offers a range of <a href="https://journeylite.com/weight-loss-medications/">weight loss medications</a>, including prescription drugs and injections. These medications are designed for your specific needs and medical history, and they work by suppressing appetite, increasing metabolism, or inhibiting fat absorption. Our medical professionals will thoroughly evaluate you to determine the most appropriate medication and provide ongoing monitoring and support to ensure your success.</p>
    <p>We design our non-surgical weight loss services to provide flexible and effective options to achieve your desired weight loss outcomes. Whether you choose the gastric balloon or weight loss medications, our dedicated team is here to support you. At JourneyLite, we are committed to helping you achieve a healthier, happier life through personalized and compassionate care.</p>
