        <h3>Gastric Balloon</h3>
        <p><strong>The gastric balloon non-surgical weight loss procedures involve placing a temporary gastric balloon in the stomach. </strong>This method helps in controlling portion sizes and encourages the development of healthier eating habits. It's a popular choice among non-surgical weight loss options for its simplicity and effectiveness.</p>
        <h3>Endoscopic Sleeve (ESG)</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/weight-loss/endoscopic-sleeve-gastroplasty" target="_blank">Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG)</a> involves suturing the stomach from the inside to create a smaller tube-like structure, which limits food intake and promotes significant weight loss, all without the need for traditional surgery. 
            <strong>Consideration: </strong>ESG is more invasive compared to gastric balloon surgery due to the requirement of internal suturing of the stomach. In addition, we have seen a high failure rate of the endoscopic sutures, which leads to the stomach expanding back to normal capacity. For this reason, we have paused our ESG program until the technology improves.</p>
        <h3>Aspire Assist Device</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-aspireassist-obesity-device" target="_blank">Aspire Assist Device</a> involves placing a small tube in the stomach, allowing for the controlled removal of a portion of stomach contents after eating. This process assists in managing calorie intake and supports weight loss efforts by reducing the number of calories absorbed by the body.</p>
        <p><strong>Consideration: </strong>This procedure requires frequent monitoring with regular medical visits to ensure proper functioning and tube adjustment as weight is lost. Because of the high maintenance and inconsistent long-term results, we have not opted to offer the Aspire Assist at JourneyLite</p>
        <h3>Weight Loss Medication</h3>
        <p>JourneyLite offers a range of medical weight loss programs, including both <a href="/weight-loss-medications/">oral and injectable medications</a>. These options serve as appetite suppressants, aiding in effective weight loss. Our oral medication choices include Adipex (phentermine), Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate), and Contrave (naltrexone/bupropion). For injectable options, we provide Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide). </p>

        <h2>Comparing Non-Surgical Weight-Loss Options: Orbera vs. Spatz Gastric Balloons</h2>
        <p>Gastric balloons offer a reliable solution for those seeking an alternative to surgery. Understanding the differences between the Orbera and Spatz <a href="/non-surgical-weight-loss/gastric-balloon/">gastric balloons</a> can help in making an informed decision.</p>
        <h3>Orbera Gastric Balloon</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://apolloendo.com/patients/orbera/" target="_blank">Orbera gastric balloon</a> is a temporary, non-surgical device placed in the stomach to aid in weight loss. It works by occupying space in the stomach, promoting a feeling of fullness and reducing overall food intake.</p>
        <h3>Spatz Gastric Balloon</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.spatzmedical.com/" target="_blank">Spatz gastric balloon</a> offers a non-surgical solution similar to Orbera but with the added feature of adjustability. This allows for the balloonâ€™s size to be modified during the treatment period to better suit individual needs and enhance comfort.</p>
        <p>Because each balloon type has unique features, we can provide detailed advice on which non-surgical weight loss option might be best suited for your individual weight loss goals.</p>

        <h2>What Are the Risks of the Non-Surgical Weight-Loss Options?</h2>
        <p>While non-surgical weight-loss options are generally safer than surgical methods, they are not risk-free. Gastric balloon procedures, ESG and the Aspire each carry specific risks.
