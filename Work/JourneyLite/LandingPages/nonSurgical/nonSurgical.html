        <h3>Gastric Balloon</h3>
        <p><strong>The gastric balloon non-surgical weight loss procedures involve placing a temporary gastric balloon in the stomach. </strong>This method helps in controlling portion sizes and encourages the development of healthier eating habits. It's a popular choice among non-surgical weight loss options for its simplicity and effectiveness.</p>
        <h3>Endoscopic Sleeve (ESG)</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/weight-loss/endoscopic-sleeve-gastroplasty" target="_blank">Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG)</a> involves suturing the stomach from the inside to create a smaller tube-like structure, which limits food intake and promotes significant weight loss, all without the need for traditional surgery. 
            <strong>Consideration: </strong>ESG is more invasive compared to gastric balloon surgery due to the requirement of internal suturing of the stomach. In addition, we have seen a high failure rate of the endoscopic sutures, which leads to the stomach expanding back to normal capacity. For this reason, we have paused our ESG program until the technology improves.</p>
        <h3>Aspire Assist Device</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-aspireassist-obesity-device" target="_blank">Aspire Assist Device</a> involves placing a small tube in the stomach, allowing for the controlled removal of a portion of stomach contents after eating. This process assists in managing calorie intake and supports weight loss efforts by reducing the number of calories absorbed by the body.</p>
        <p><strong>Consideration: </strong>This procedure requires frequent monitoring with regular medical visits to ensure proper functioning and tube adjustment as weight is lost. Because of the high maintenance and inconsistent long-term results, we have not opted to offer the Aspire Assist at JourneyLite</p>
        <h3>Weight Loss Medication</h3>
        <p>JourneyLite offers a range of medical weight loss programs, including both <a href="/weight-loss-medications/">oral and injectable medications</a>. These options serve as appetite suppressants, aiding in effective weight loss. Our oral medication choices include Adipex (phentermine), Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate), and Contrave (naltrexone/bupropion). For injectable options, we provide Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide). </p>

        <h2>Comparing Non-Surgical Weight-Loss Options: Orbera vs. Spatz Gastric Balloons</h2>
        <p>Gastric balloons offer a reliable solution for those seeking an alternative to surgery. Understanding the differences between the Orbera and Spatz <a href="/non-surgical-weight-loss/gastric-balloon/">gastric balloons</a> can help in making an informed decision.</p>
        <h3>Orbera Gastric Balloon</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://apolloendo.com/patients/orbera/" target="_blank">Orbera gastric balloon</a> is a temporary, non-surgical device placed in the stomach to aid in weight loss. It works by occupying space in the stomach, promoting a feeling of fullness and reducing overall food intake.</p>
        <h3>Spatz Gastric Balloon</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.spatzmedical.com/" target="_blank">Spatz gastric balloon</a> offers a non-surgical solution similar to Orbera but with the added feature of adjustability. This allows for the balloon’s size to be modified during the treatment period to better suit individual needs and enhance comfort.</p>
        <p>Because each balloon type has unique features, we can provide detailed advice on which non-surgical weight loss option might be best suited for your individual weight loss goals.</p>

        <h2>What Are the Risks of the Non-Surgical Weight-Loss Options?</h2>
        <p>While non-surgical weight-loss options are generally safer than surgical methods, they are not risk-free. Gastric balloon procedures, ESG and the Aspire each carry specific risks.
