<p>There are a couple of different names to describe the gastric sleeve procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>vertical gastrectomy</li>
<li>sleeve gastrectomy</li>
<li>vertical sleeve gastrectomy</li>
<li>VSG</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all describing the same type of surgery, which is overall a newer procedure being performed for weight loss. It is done with the laparoscopic technique, similar to the <a href="https://lapband.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lap Band</a> and <a href="https://journeylite.com/courses/surgery-pre-op-class-medical/lesson/gastric-bypass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lap Gastric Bypass</a>. It involves removing the portion of the stomach that functions mainly as a storage tank for food to make it much smaller, so it doesn't take much to make you feel full. This is similar in concept to the <a href="https://www.lapband.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lap Band System</a>, although most patients report a lot less hunger after a sleeve than a band. Most studies show that the weight loss with a sleeve is slightly less than with a gastric bypass but slightly more than with a Lap Band. Also, many studies show up to an 80% remission rate for Type II diabetes![/vc_column_text][vc_cta h2="$5000 off self-pay gastric sleeve!" style="3d" color="violet" add_button="bottom" btn_title="Click to save!" btn_style="3d" btn_link="url:https%3A%2F%2Fjourneylite.com%2Fself-pay-gastric-sleeve-only-10000%2F"]Find out more about our limited-time $10,000 self-pay gastric sleeve![/vc_cta][vc_column_text]</p>

<p>[/vc_column_text][vc_video link="https://youtu.be/qfWZ-8lzpIE" align="center" title="Gastric Sleeve Infobit"][vc_column_text]The gastric sleeve has become the most commonly-performed weight loss surgery, mostly due to the fact that it has the lowest long-term risk.  In many cases it can be done on an outpatient basis, with as little as a week or two off work.</p>
<p>There are some advantages and disadvantages to this procedure:</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since there is no mechanical device, there are fewer food intolerances with vertical sleeve than with the Lap Band.</li>
<li>Weight loss is much faster with sleeve than with the Lap Band.</li>
<li>Removal of the portion of stomach that secretes hunger hormones such as ghrelin can result in better hunger reduction than with the Lap Band.</li>
<li>There is no implantable device, so things like band slips and erosions aren't a concern down the road with the vertical sleeve gastrectomy.</li>
<li>The risk is lower than with gastric bypass, yet the weight loss is similar.</li>
<li>Since there is no device to adjust, the follow-up regimen not as intense as for the Lap Band.</li>
<li>If weight regain occurs it can easily be converted to a <a href="https://journeylite.com/courses/surgery-pre-op-class-medical/lesson/gastric-bypass/">gastric bypass</a> or <a href="http://journeylite.com/sips-procedure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SIPS</a> which will likely lead to additional weight loss.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since this is a newer procedure (15+ years) it is less time-tested than gastric bypass.</li>
<li>Unlike the Lap Band, it is non-adjustable.</li>
<li>Unlike the Lap Band, it is non-reversible.</li>
<li>The short-term risk is slightly higher than with Lap Band, however the long-term risk is much lower as there is no foreign body.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operation Details:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The surgery usually takes us less than an hour to perform and it is done with five tiny incisions that add up altogether to about 2.5 total inches.</li>
<li>Many patients are able to go home the day of surgery!</li>
<li>Diet is advanced slowly, starting with clear liquids and ending at soft solid foods by week four.</li>
<li>Most patients will lose about 60-70% of their excess body weight in a year.</li>
<li>We have the most competitive pricing for self-pay sleeve patients in the region.  <a href="http://journeylite.com/financing-options/">Click here for details</a>.</li>
<li>We are also in-network with almost all private insurance companies including Anthem, Aetna, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Cigna, Medical Mutual, and others!</li>
<li>We have performed more laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy's (over 6000) than any other practice in Cincinnati.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sleeve gastrectomy is also a good revision procedure for band patients who have had either failed weight loss or had to have their band removed. We have performed this procedure for patients from all over the country and have had excellent results.</p>
