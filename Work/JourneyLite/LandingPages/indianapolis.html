    <h2>Weight Loss Surgery for Indianapolis Residents</h2>
    <p>For those seeking weight loss surgery in Indianapolis, JourneyLite provides comprehensive weight loss options at our main office and surgery center in Cincinnati, just a short two-hour drive away. <strong>Our team of expert medical professionals and surgeons collaborates with you to determine the best surgical approach to help you achieve significant and lasting results.</strong> Our surgical weight loss services include:</p>
    <h3>Gastric Sleeve</h3>
    <p>This treatment, also known as <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/gastric-sleeve-vsg/">sleeve gastrectomy</a>, decreases the size of your stomach by taking out a portion to create a sleeve-shaped organ. The procedure cuts down the amount of food you can eat, promoting effective long-term weight loss by allowing you to feel fuller sooner.</p>
    <h3>Lap Band</h3>
    <p>We create a small pouch during a <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/lap-band/">lap band</a> procedure by securing an adjustable band around your upper stomach. This slows digestion and cuts food intake, helping you lose weight by eating less. As time goes by, we can adjust the band to ensure optimal results.</p>
    <h3>Gastric Bypass</h3>
    <p>Our team creates a small stomach pouch and reroutes a section of your small intestine during <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/gastric-bypass-surgery/">gastric bypass surgery</a>. This decreases the amount of food you can eat and reduces calorie absorption, allowing you to lose significant weight.</p>
    <h3>SADI Surgery</h3>
    <p>A newer procedure, the single anastomosis duodenal-ileal (<a href="/surgical-weight-loss/sadi-surgery/">SADI</a>) bypass with sleeve gastrectomy, combines aspects of the gastric bypass and gastric sleeve. It involves bypassing a portion of your small intestine and creating a sleeve-shaped stomach. The two-pronged approach improves metabolic health and promotes substantial weight loss.</p>
    <h3>Gastric Band Revision</h3>
    <p>If you experience insufficient weight loss or complications from lap band surgery, we can provide a <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/weight-loss-surgery-revisions/gastric-band-revision/">gastric band revision</a>. In this procedure, we remove or adjust the gastric band to improve outcomes and address issues.</p>
    <h3>Gastric Sleeve Revision</h3>
    <p>We offer <a href="/surgical-weight-loss/weight-loss-surgery-revisions/gastric-sleeve-revision/">gastric sleeve revision surgery</a> for those facing complications or weight regain after a gastric sleeve procedure. This additional procedure can help you get back on track by resolving any issues.</p>
    <p>Our team provides the highest standards of care and the most advanced surgical techniques to help you achieve your weight loss goals. You get all the assistance you need, from the initial consultation to post-surgery follow-ups and beyond.</p>

    <h2>Non-Surgical Weight Loss Options</h2>
    <p>We understand that surgery might not be the right fit for everyone. That's why <strong>we also offer the gastric balloon procedure</strong>. This temporary, non-surgical weight loss option places a soft, expandable balloon in your stomach. Taking up space in your stomach, the balloon helps you feel full sooner and eat less. </p>
    <p>The <a href="/weight-loss-medications/gastric-balloon-surgery/">gastric balloon procedure</a> is performed endoscopically, so no incisions are required. We leave the balloon in place for six months, during which time our team provides comprehensive guidance and support to help you develop healthy eating habits and achieve your weight loss goals.</p>
