<h2>How Does Medical Weight Loss Work?</h2>
<p>Medical weight loss is usually defined as participating in a physician-and-dietitian supervised weight loss program, often involving the use of prescription appetite suppressants.</p>
<p>The classic medication typically used in the past has been Adipex (generic: phentermine), because it is affordable and effective. However there are several newer medications now available. Explore them below. </p>

<h2>Oral Weight Loss Medications</h2>
<p>We offer many different medical weight loss programs utilizing <a href="https://journeylite.com/oral-weight-loss-medications/">oral prescription appetite suppressants</a> including: </p>
<ul>
    <li><h3><a href="https://journeylite.com/weight-loss-medications/apidex/">Adipex (Phentermine)</a></h3>
        <p>Adipex is a powerful appetite suppressant that can help you lose weight by decreasing cravings and hunger, while stimulating metabolism. The State Medical Board of Ohio recently adopted <a href="https://journeylite.com/new-2023-ohio-rules-for-weight-loss-medications/">new rules around weight loss medications</a>, making access to Adipex easier for residents. </p></li>
    <li><h3><a href="https://journeylite.com/oral-weight-loss-medications/qsymia/">Qsymia (Phentermine/Topiramate)</a></h3>
        <p>Qsymia is a combination of two older medications, phentermine and topiramate, that work together to suppress appetite and enhance feelings of fullness. It comes in 4 strengths, so the dosage can be increased with time if a patient starts to feel less hunger control.</p></li>
    <li><h3><a href="https://journeylite.com/oral-weight-loss-medications/contrave/">Contrave (Naltrexone/Bupropion)</a></h3>
        <p>Contrave is a unique non-stimulant combination drug that impacts both hunger and cravings.This medication targets key areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation and reward systems to help control eating habits, making it an innovative option for weight management alongside lifestyle changes.</p></li>

<h2>Injectable Weight Loss Medication</h2>
<p>Prescription weight loss medication comes in <a href="https://journeylite.com/injectable-medications-for-weight-loss/">injectable forms</a> as well. Here are two that JourneyLite offers: </p>
<ul>
    <li><h3><a href="https://journeylite.com/wegovy/">Wegovy (semaglutide)</a></h3>
        <p>Wegovy (generic: semaglutide) is a new injectable weight loss medication that works by interacting with GLP-1 receptors in your body.  GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide) is an appetite hormone that is naturally produced in humans that helps to regulate hunger. Wegovy has shown promising results in clinical trials, contributing to significant weight loss in many patients.</p></li>
    <li><h3><a href="https://journeylite.com/zepbound-a-new-injectable-fda-approved-weight-loss-drug/">Zepbound (tirzepatide)</a></h3>
        <p>Zepbound represents a cutting-edge advancement in weight loss injectables, containing the active component tirzepatide, which influences both insulin and glucagon levels to help control blood sugar and suppress appetite. Like Wegovy, Zebpound/tirzepatide is a one-a-week injection. </p></li>

<h2>Weight Loss Medication Pricing</h2>
<p>Our appetite suppression programs are designed to be effective and affordable for patients.  Although not typically covered by insurance, HSA or FLEX spending accounts can typically be utilized.</p>
<h3>Initial Consultations</h3>
<p>An initial consultation with our medical team and a registered dietitian is priced at $199, with a $30 deposit required upon booking. This deposit is non-refundable and will be applied to your initial appointment cost, ensuring your commitment to embarking on this transformative journey.</p>
<h3>Medication Prescriptions</h3>
<p>The prices of these medications can vary widely, depending on the specific drug and dosage required for your treatment. Many JourneyLite patients utilize Health Savings Accounts (HSA) or Flexible Spending Accounts (FLEX) to offset some of the costs.</p>
<p>Additionally, cost-effective generic options are available. However, some treatment plans may recommend brand-name prescriptions, which tend to be higher in cost but might be preferable in certain cases.</p>
<h3>Follow Up Visits</h3>
<p>Follow-up visits, priced at $129, continue the comprehensive care model, featuring both medical and dietary consultations.
