    <p>If you're looking for semaglutide in Ohio, you've come to the right place. JourneyLite prescribes Wegovy to Ohio patients who can benefit from it. </p>
    <h2>What Is Wegovy (Semaglutide)?</h2>
    <p>Wegovy is an injectable weight loss medication in the same family as Saxenda (a GLP-1 receptor agonist).  Unlike Saxenda, however, Wegovy only needs to be injected once a week! </p>

        alt="Semaglutide in Ohio"></div>
    <h3>How Wegovy (Semaglutide) Works</h3>
    <p>Wegovy works by interacting with GLP-1 receptors in your body.  GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide) is an appetite hormone that is naturally produced in humans that helps to regulate hunger.  Saxenda and Wegovy work like GLP-1 by controlling your appetite, which leads to decreased calorie consumption and, therefore, weight loss.</p>
    <p>Wegovy comes in a single-use pen that makes injections very simple. The dosage is adjusted over five months, starting at 0.25 milligrams in the first month and going to 2.4 milligrams in month five. Each dose comes in one pack of four pens and contains only the specific monthly dosage.</p>
    <h3>The Benefits of Wegovy</h3>
    <p>A number of studies have shown the advantages of Wegovy. People who use this medication report a variety of benefits, including appetite reduction, improved metabolic health, and weight management.</p>
    <h3>Wegovy vs. Surgery</h3>
    <p>While Wegovy offers benefits, it is often considered a temporary solution or "Band-Aid." For sustainable results, patients should consider complementing semaglutide with long-term strategies like <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/">weight loss surgery</a>.</p>

    <h2>Wegovy Pricing</h2>
    <p>The manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, offers a savings program where eligible patients who are commercially insured for Wegovy can get the medication without additional payment. This is subject to a maximum savings of $225 per 28-day supply for up to 13 fills. Patients who pay cash for their prescriptions or whose commercial insurance does not cover Wegovy can expect to pay $650 per 28-day supply.</p>
    <p>Eligibility and other restrictions apply. The manufacturer reserves the right to cancel or modify this program at any time. Consult your insurer to learn what coverage applies to your situation. You must know your financial responsibility for Wegovy before you come in for a consultation!</p>
    <div class="obx-section jump-links-box">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Semaglutide Prescriptions for Less</h3>
        <p>For patients who do not have coverage and can't afford brand-name Wegovy, we have a partnership with <a href="https://univrx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Medivera</a> in Troy, Michigan. They can provide a generic compounded semaglutide injection for around 25% of the cost of the brand-name pens! These savings are available as long as Wegovy remains on the FDA shortage list. <a href="https://journeylite.com/nobody-can-afford-wegovy/">Learn more about this option</a>.</p>

    <h2>Instructions for Use</h2>
    <p>Wegovy is typically injected into the skin of the lower abdomen.  Make sure to clean the injection site with soap and water or an alcohol swab first.  Simply insert the tiny needle all the way into the skin and press the button on the end of the syringe.  Two clicks will be heard â€” after the second click, keep holding down the button until the yellow bar stops moving.  You can get further instructions and watch a video on how to inject the drug on the official <a href="https://www.wegovy.com/tools-and-resources/get-started-on-wegovy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" >Wegovy website</a>.</p>
    <p>Pens must be disposed of in a sturdy household container with a tight-fitting lid or an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container.</p>
</div>
<div class="obx-section bg-color">
<h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Who Is the Ideal Candidate for Semaglutide?</h2>
<p>Like Saxenda, semaglutide is approved by the FDA for patients with a BMI of 27 to 30 if they have weight-related medical problems or any patient with a BMI over 30.</p>
<p>People with a family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or an endocrine system condition called MEN 2 (multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2) should not take this medication. You should not use Wegovy if you are allergic to any Wegovy ingredients, like semaglutide.</p>
