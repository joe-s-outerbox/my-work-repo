        <p>People looking for tirzepatide in Ohio can rely on JourneyLite for the medications they need to lose weight. We provide tirzepatide and Zepbound prescriptions for Ohio residents who can benefit from this treatment.</p>
        <h2>What is Tirzepatide (Zepbound)?</h2>
        <p>Zepbound is an injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist approved by the FDA in 2023 for weight loss.  The generic name for Zepbound is tirzepatide. It is the same molecule as the diabetes medicine known as Mounjaro.</p>

        <h3>How Tirzepatide (Zepbound) Works</h3>
        <p>A tirzepatide or Zepbound prescription is the first weight loss medication that activates both the GLP-1 and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptors. This means that in addition to helping modify signals of fullness to your brain, it also activates the GIP receptors, which may improve how your body breaks down fats and sugars.</p>
        <p>Based on data submitted to the FDA from <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04184622" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SURMOUNT-1</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01292-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SURMOUNT-2</a> trials, researchers showed weight loss out to 72 weeks of 48 pounds on average with the highest dose of 15 mg.  Even at the lowest dose (5 mg), patients lost 34 pounds on average.</p>
        <h3>The Benefits of Tirzepatide</h3>
        <p>Tirzepatide benefits include improved metabolic health, appetite reduction, and long-term weight management. Another possible advantage of using Zepbound in Ohio is the body's improved ability to better break down sugars and fats.</p>
        <h3>A Zepbound Prescription vs. Surgery</h3>
        <p>While a Zepbound prescription can help you lose weight, the benefits disappear once you stop taking the medication. Those looking for longer-lasting results may want to consider <a href="https://journeylite.com/surgical-weight-loss/">weight loss surgery</a>, like a gastric sleeve.</p>

        <h2>Zepbound Prescription Pricing</h2>
        <p>People with commercial health insurance coverage may be eligible for the Zepbound Savings Card, which lets them pay as little as $25 for a one-month or three-month Zepbound prescription. Those with commercial health insurance that doesn't cover Zepbound will spend around $550 for a one-month supply. Lilly, the manufacturer, reserves the right to change its savings card program at any time.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Better Pricing for Tirzepatide in Ohio</h3>
            <p>Thanks to our partnership with <a href="https://univrx.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">University Compounding Pharmacy</a> in Troy, Michigan, you can initially pay as little as $233, which covers one month of tirzepatide, syringes, and shipping. We can provide this pricing as long as Zepbound remains on the FDA's shortage list. However, some patients prefer paying once for surgery compared to the constant payments required for medications.</p>

        <h2>Instructions for Using Tirzepatide</h2>
        <p>Wash your hands before handling the tirzepatide pen. Inspect the pen to see if it's damaged or if the medicine is frozen or cloudy. If everything is OK, pull the gray base cap straight off and throw it away. </p>
        <p>Then, place the clear base flat against the injection site on your abdomen or thigh and unlock it by turning the lock ring. Press the purple injection button and hold it for up to 10 seconds. After you hear two clicks, you'll know the injection is complete. The gray plunger also should be visible.</p>
        <p>Always dispose of the used pen in a household container with a tightly fitting lid or an FDA-approved sharps container. Never put the pen in your regular trash.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Who is the Ideal Candidate for Tirzepatide?</h2>
    <p>Patients are eligible to use Zepbound or tirzepatide for losing weight if they have a body mass index (BMI) of 27 to 30 with weight-related medical issues or a BMI over 30.  <a href="https://journeylite.com/bmi-calculator/">You can check out your BMI here</a>.</p>
    <p>People who have a condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndrome or a history of thyroid cancer in their family should not use Zepbound. You should avoid this medication if you're allergic to tirzepatide or any other ingredients in Zepbound.</p>
    <p>Those looking for long-term results without having to constantly take medication may prefer weight loss surgery.</p>
