In Georgia, asset division during a divorce follows the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equitable-division.asp" target="_blank">"equitable distribution"</a> principle, meaning the Court divides assets fairly, though not always equally. High-asset divorces can involve complex valuations of businesses, properties, investments, and retirement accounts.

<strong>Our family divorce lawyers recognize that you may desire to preserve your hard-earned assets throughout a divorce.</strong> We will go through the numerous factors that affect high-asset divorce in Georgia and advise you on how to safeguard your distinct property holdings.

Under Georgia law, establishing paternity is essential for fathers seeking <a href="https://jgboydlaw.com/fathersrights/">legal fathers' rights</a> to their children born outside of wedlock. This process involves legal actions to legitimate the child, thereby granting a father custody, visitation rights, and responsibilities for child support.<strong> Our firm assists in navigating these procedures, ensuring fathersâ€™ rights are recognized and they remain integral in their children's lives.</strong>

Georgia courts prioritize the child's best interests when determining custody arrangements. <strong>Some factors considered include each parent's relationship with the child, the child's home environment, and the mental and physical health of all parties involved.</strong> Our objective is to advocate for a custody solution that reflects your child's best interests while also respecting your rights and desires as a parent.

Visitation rights in Georgia are designed to foster a healthy relationship between the non-custodial parent and child. These agreements are intended to assist parents in maintaining and protecting their relationship with their children. You and your co-parent can either agree on a visiting schedule that works for both of you, or the Court will decide what is best. <strong>We will assist you in negotiating a good settlement or represent you in court if the Court is required to make the ultimate decision.</strong> We can also assist you in obtaining a court order to modify visits.

Georgia's laws on spousal and child support consider numerous factors, including each party's financial standing, the child's needs and the duration of the marriage. <strong>We will advise you on what the law says about spouse and child support and assist you in obtaining the best possible conclusion in a spousal and child support dispute.</strong> We can also assist you if you believe you may require spousal or child support changes as a result of your former spouse's change.
