                    <p>
                        The amount of high bay light fixtures needed is determined by the size of the space, ceiling height,
                        and building usage. For ceiling heights of between 12-20 feet, high bay lights in the 125-175 watt
                        (12000-21000 lumens) range are most commonly used.

            <p class="h3">As the ceiling height increases, the wattage and

                        <li>18-25 feet = 200-300 watt (22,000-35,000 lumens)</li>

                    <p>
                        These are the most recognized types of high bay lighting. Linear high bay LED lights illuminate
                        large indoor spaces with high ceilings, typically 20 to 45 feet. Their rectangular shape allows
                        for broad light distribution, focusing brightness downward and outward to cover expansive areas.
                        Unlike round or bell-shaped fixtures, linear high bays offer more coverage along aisles or long
                        spaces. They can be installed directly onto ceilings or suspended using chains or cables,
                        providing versatility for various layouts. These fixtures ensure bright, efficient lighting for
                        warehouses, retail stores, and industrial environments.

            <h3>What are High Bay LED Lights?</h3>
            <p>
                High bay LED lights are used to illuminate spaces with high ceilings. That usually means ceilings
                ranging from 20 feet to approximately 45 feet. Low-bay lights, on the other hand, are used for ceilings
                20 feet and under. Because a high-ceiling location has more space to fill, a high bay light by
                definition is a powerful light source that can brighten up a large area.

            <h3>What is the maximum lumen output available for high bay LED lights?</h3>
            <p>
                High bay LED lights can reach over 60,000 lumens, making them ideal for spaces with high ceilings or
                demanding lighting requirements.

        <div class="white-box">
            <h3>How do high lumen high bay lights improve visibility and safety in large spaces?</h3>
            <p>
                They provide bright, even coverage, reducing shadows and dark spots to ensure clear visibility, which
                enhances safety and productivity
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="white-box">
            <h3>Are high-lumen lights energy-efficient despite their high brightness?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. LEDs produce more lumens per watt than traditional lights, delivering bright illumination while
                consuming minimal energy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="white-box">
            <h3>How does the lumen output affect the number of fixtures needed in a space?</h3>
            <p>
                Higher lumen output means fewer fixtures are required to achieve the desired brightness, lowering
                installation and energy costs.
