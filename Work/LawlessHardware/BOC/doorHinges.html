                        <div class="answer">Use a soft, damp cloth to wipe the surface. For metal hinges, a mild soap
                            solution can be used. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as these can damage the
                            finish. Periodically, lube the door hinges with WD-40 or petroleum jelly to keep them from
                            squeaking. Finally, tighten any loose screws.

                    <h2>Types of Residential Hinges for Cabinet Doors</h2>
                    <p>There are three primary types of residential hinges, each with its unique uses and benefits. The
                        type of door hinge you choose will depend on the type and weight of the door, your aesthetic
                        preferences and your functional needs.</p>
                    <h3>Butt Hinges</h3>
                    <p>Butt hinges are the most common hinges for residential cabinet doors. Named due to their design
                        where the two plates butt up against each other, <a
                            href="https://www.dlawlesshardware.com/butt-and-surface-mount-hinges.html">butt hinges</a>
                        are durable and can carry a lot of weight. They're ideal for most types of interior and exterior
                        doors. Their classic design blends well with any decor, and they can be painted over to match
                        the door or trim color.</p>
                    <h3>Pivot Hinges</h3>
                    <p>Instead of being attached to the side of the door and the frame, pivot hinges are installed at
                        the top and bottom of the door. This design makes them ideal for large, heavy doors, as the
                        weight is distributed evenly over the floor and the top frame, reducing strain on the hinge.
                        Pivot hinges provide smooth and quiet operation and offer a clean, modern aesthetic.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Concealed Hinges</h3>
                    <p>Also known as <a href="https://www.dlawlesshardware.com/european-hinges.html">European hinges</a>
                        or cup hinges, are concealed residential hinges popular for their seamless look. As the name
                        suggests, these hinges are hidden inside the door when closed, offering a neat finish. The main
                        benefit of concealed hinges is their aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, they offer adjustable
                        settings for alignment, ensuring a perfect fit and smooth operation. </p>

                    <h2>Choosing the Best Finish for Residential Cabinet Door Hinges</h2>
                    <p>Hardware finishes for residential door hinges protect the underlying materials and significantly
                        contribute to the aesthetic appeal of your hardware accessories. Let's take a closer look at
                        some common finishes and their unique characteristics:</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="two-column flex-row" style="padding-top: 0">
                <div class="left" style="padding-top: unset;">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Antique Brass:</strong> With its timeless look, warm golden hues and aged
                            appearance, antique brass complements traditional or rustic decor, adding a touch of
                            elegance and history.</li>
                        <li><strong>Antique Pewter:</strong> Its rich, dark gray hue carries a slightly weathered or
                            distressed look. Antique pewter pairs well with both modern and vintage styles, bringing an
                            old-world charm to the interior.</li>
                        <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> This bright, shiny finish has contemporary appeal. It's highly
                            reflective, creating a sleek look. Chrome is also resistant to tarnish and corrosion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Polished Brass:</strong> With a shiny, golden color, polished brass brings a touch
                            of luxury and sophistication to residential cabinet hardware hinges. It's often associated
                            with traditional and formal decors, although it can also add an unexpected pop of brightness
                            in modern settings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Satin Brass:</strong> This is a softer, muted golden tone compared to polished
                            brass. It offers a warm, sophisticated finish without the high shine for optimal
                            versatility.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="right" style="padding-top: unset;">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Satin Nickel:</strong> With a soft, subtle sheen and smooth texture, satin nickel's
                            silver-gray color gives it a contemporary feel to residential hinges for cabinets and pairs
                            well with various color palettes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solid Brass:</strong> Because it's made entirely of brass, you get a rich,
                            high-quality appearance with excellent corrosion resistance. The color ranges from bright,
                            shiny gold to a deeper, muted gold, depending on whether it's polished or left in a more
                            natural state.</li>
                        <li><strong>Venetian Bronze:</strong> Venetian bronze is a rich, dark finish with warm copper
                            undertones. It often includes subtle brush strokes that add depth and character that pairs
                            well with rustic, traditional, or Mediterranean styles.</li>
                        <li><strong>White/Black:</strong> Solid color finishes create a clean, fresh look. These
                            residential door hinges create a modern, minimalist aesthetic that partners easily with
                            various materials.</li>
