<h2>The Story Behind HiPP Formula Brand</h2>
<p>The HiPP baby formula brand was founded in Pfaffenhofen in the late 19th century by Joseph Hipp, whose wife had trouble breastfeeding her twins. As a baker, he solved his twins' nutrition problems by baking rusks and enriching their milk with rusk flour.</p>
<p>In the mid-20th century, Georg Hipp started manufacturing weaning food and switched to packaging in jars. </p>
<p>The HiPP product range expanded to include organic farming, and Claus Hipp travelled to raise awareness and build a network of organic farms. The family-owned Ehrensberg farm near Pfaffenhofen converted to organic production, and HiPP became a pioneer in organic farming.</p>
<p>For more than 50 years, the HiPP company has been associated with thoughtful and conscientious treatment of the environment, people, and the economy. Every HiPP organic baby formula product comes with a personal assurance from Claus Hipp that it is of the highest caliber.</p>
