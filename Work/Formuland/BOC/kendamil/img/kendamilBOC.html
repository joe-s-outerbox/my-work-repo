But what sets our goat milk formula apart is its unique taste, perfect for babies who may not tolerate conventional cow's milk formulas. Additionally, our A2 milk comes from specially selected cows producing only A beta-casein protein, which may contribute to improved tolerance. Whichever formula you choose, Holle prioritizes quality, taste, and value for your family's peace of mind. Give your baby the best start with Holle formula - recommended from birth and throughout the first year of life."}} ]}
