Do not use any other scoop or measuring device. Do not alter the strength of the formula by adding extra water or scoops. Follow the recommended quantity of water and measuring spoon specified for each stage. For hygiene reasons, always prepare fresh feeds and avoid preparing them in advance. Use the prepared formula within 2 hours. Discard any leftover formula after feeding. Do not heat the formula in a microwave, as it may create hot spots and cause scalding. Use alternative methods for warming the formula, such as a bottle warmer or warm water bath. Introduce a cup or beaker as soon as possible to prevent prolonged or frequent contact of teeth with milk feeds, which can increase the risk of tooth decay.
