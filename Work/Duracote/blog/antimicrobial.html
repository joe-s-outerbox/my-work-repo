                        <p><strong>Antimicrobial materials in aircraft interiors utilize advanced technologies like silver ion to combat the growth of bacteria, mold, and mildew effectively.</strong> Silver ions are highly reactive atoms that, by losing an electron, become capable of attacking and disrupting the cellular processes of various pathogens. This interaction primarily targets the DNA and cellular proteins of microorganisms, hindering their ability to replicate and thus inhibiting the spread of infections.</p>
