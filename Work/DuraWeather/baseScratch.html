  <h3>Q: Will DuraWeather poly outdoor furniture fade, crack, or rust? </h3>DuraWeather <a
    href="https://duraweather.com/collections/quick-ship">poly outdoor furniture</a> is made from 95% premium high
  density polyethylene with all-season additives. This means our Adirondack furniture and outdoor poly furniture will
  not fade, crack, peel, or warp. While our poly lumber is virtually indestructible, our 316 stainless steel hardware
  resists rust and corrosion, making it the ideal maintenance-free patio furniture.</p>

  <h3>Q: How long do hammocks take to ship and what is the assembly time?</h3>
  <p>Our <a
      href="https://duraweather.com/collections/footstools-accessories/products/original-large-plush-pillowtop-hammock-1">hammocks
      and stands</a> are shipped within 24 to 48 hours and assembly time is only 3 minutes or less.</p>

  <h3>Q: Are the canopies of umbrellas washable and will it fit in my washing machine?</h3>
  <p>The canopies of all of our umbrellas are easily removable with no need for tools to take off. The fabric canopy can
    be thrown in the wash. To dry, simply put the umbrella canopy back on the frame of the umbrella. Do not put the
    umbrella canopy in the dryer. The umbrellas stems are a universal 1-1/2" inch diameter.</p>

  <h3>Q: What if my product does not arrive?</h3>
  <p>DuraWeather® guarantees the successful delivery of your order with the shipping address you provide or your money
    back.</p>

  <h3>Q: Do the hardwood lanterns come with a remote control?</h3>
  <p>Yes! The lanterns also require AAA batteries, which must be purchased separately.</p>

  <h3>Q: How long will it take to receive my order?</h3>
  <p>Our ship dates are listed in large bold font underneath each product title name as well as on each product
    categories header. It is also found on our weekly newsletter if you are subscribed. </p>

  <h3>Q: What does the grade of wood mean on teak furniture?</h3>
  <p>Lumber is graded based on the quality and appearance of the wood. This depends on various factors like the type of
    wood used and the number and types of defects. Our quality Grade A Perhutani Teak is free from: bow, check, crook,
    cup, knots, shake, split, twist, and wane.</p>

  <h3>Q: How do I assemble my new poly outdoor furniture?</h3>
  <p>Easy-to-follow assembly instructions are included with every purchase on most items. Assembly of our poly outdoor
    furniture takes approximately 3-5 minutes for chairs, and only requires a wrench. Assembly of tables, chaise
    lounges, swings, and larger sets take approximately 10-15 minutes. To ensure you have absolutely no hassle
    assembling our furniture, we've even included simple assembly videos for certain products.
  </p>

  <h3>Q: Will poly furniture scratch or show marks easily?</h3>
  <p>DuraWeather poly lumber is one of the highest strength-to-density materials on the market and withstands scratching
    from common everyday use of plates, glasses, keys, phones and all other commonly used items. Traditional teak wood
    is excellent for outdoor use and has an incredible strength to density ratio and is not easily scratched or marked.
  </p>

  <h3>Q: How does poly lumber compare to wood?</h3>
  <p>Unlike traditional wood, DuraWeather poly outdoor furniture is maintenance free. You won't have to go through
    vigorous efforts to stain, sand, and waterproof our material every year. Not only that! You won't have moldy,
    rotten, insect infested furniture. Our poly outdoor furniture resists these nasty culprits! The only wood we stand
    by for outdoor use is Teak Grade A only as it is best for outdoor protection from nature's harsh elements and
    insects.</p>

  <h3>Q: What is DuraWeather's product warranty?</h3>
  <p>Our warranty varies per product. Please see our complete warranty information page for more details.</p>

  <h2>How is HDPE Polyethylene or Poly Lumber Produced?</h2>
  <p>Poly furniture is composed of poly lumber. Poly lumber is composed of waste plastics including HDPE, PVC, PP, ABS,
    PS and PLA. The plastic material is rendered into powder or pellets, mixed to a dough-like consistency at roughly
    400 °F, and then molded to the desired shape. Additives such as colorants, coupling agents, stabilizers, blowing
    agents, reinforcing agents, foaming agents, and lubricants help tailor our poly furniture. Pre-distribution testing
    ensures the highest level of accuracy and reliability.</p>
  <h2>What is Poly Lumber?</h2>
  <p>So, what is HDPE furniture made of? High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) , also known as poly lumber, is an innovative
    material made of 100% recycled plastic. DuraWeather Poly® consists of 95% recycled plastic as well as exclusive
    all-season additives to ensure its longevity in the harshest of climates. Our poly furniture resists cracking,
    fading, and splitting unlike other poly lumber furniture. With absolutely zero maintenance it is ideal for leaving
    outside year-round.</p>
  <h2>What Kind of Hardware is Used?</h2>
  <p>Poly furniture will only last as long as the hardware used to hold it together. Most people don’t realize that the
    hardware is the main element in a quality piece of outdoor furniture. At DuraWeather, we use the highest grade of
    stainless steel available for our poly furniture, 316 Marine Grade Stainless Steel including 2% molybdenum which is
    added to help resist corrosion to chlorides (like sea water and de-icing salts).</p>
  <p>316 Stainless steel is known for its superior longevity and is commonly used in the Marine industry. Our 316
    Stainless Steel is part of the reason we offer such an incredible warranty.</p>

  <h2>When Will My Poly Furniture Ship?</h2>
  <p>All orders are shipped once production is completed. Individual cartons and smaller orders such as <a
      href="https://duraweather.com/collections/all-weather-adirondack-chairs">Adirondack chairs</a> and individual
    pieces ship with FedEx or UPS Ground, whichever will arrive at your door faster. The majority of items are shipped
    semi-assembled for easy assembly and your convenience!</p>
  <p><strong>Tracking numbers are provided once the product leaves one of our U.S. facilities.</strong> Orders will be
    left discreetly at the customers front door without signature required. Orders shipped may take 2-5 days in transit.
    Orders will ship from one of our production plants that are closest to you to ensure the quickest possible delivery
    time. Please note, if you are ordering dining and/or counter sets, not all individual pieces will be shipped
    together (the chairs might be delivered first and/or the table might be delivered first).</p>
  <p>Our current estimated ship dates of our furniture are listed on all of our quality products detail pages. Though
    rare, orders ship dates may exceed 16 weeks from date of purchase during busy times due to increased demand. During
    busy seasons our latest ship dates may be up to 16 weeks. <strong>Current ship dates are estimated and are not
      exact.</strong> All orders canceled before the latest estimated ship date will incur a 30% cancellation and
    restocking fee.</p>

      dining sets</a> and <a href="https://duraweather.com/collections/all-weather-adirondack-chairs">lounge seating</a>
