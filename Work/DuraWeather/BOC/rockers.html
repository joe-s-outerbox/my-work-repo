                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What Are Your Poly Porch Rockers Made From?</h3>
                    <p><strong>DuraWeather's porch rockers are crafted from commercial-grade <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_polyethylene" target="_blank">high-density polyethylene (HDPE)</a>, which is 100% recyclable and sustainable.</strong> This material originates from hundreds of thousands of recycled plastic bottles. After being transformed into pellets, they're melted and combined with weather-resistant additives. Not only do our Adirondack rocking chairs, <a href="/collections/poly-outdoor-dining-sets">outdoor dining sets</a> and <a href="/collections/outdoor-furniture-accessories">accessories</a> look amazing, they are good for the environment. <em>Each year, approximately 210 million recycled plastic bottles are repurposed into our durable and eco-friendly poly porch rockers!</em> </p>

                    <h3>How Do I Care for My Porch Rocker?</h3>
                    <p>Maintaining your DuraWeather poly porch rocker is simple, ensuring it looks great for over 20 years. Our poly rockers require minimal maintenance. Here's how to keep them clean:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Regular Cleaning:</strong> Mix dish soap and water in a bucket. Use a hand towel or a soft-bristled brush to remove water spots and dirt. The HDPE material doesn't stain or damage easily, maintaining its color and finish​​.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dealing with Stains:</strong> In case of tough stains or build-ups, mix 1/3 bleach with 2/3 water. Apply the mixture, let it sit for a few minutes, then scrub gently with a soft-bristled brush​​. Rinse well and air dry.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These steps will keep your poly porch rocker looking new, requiring only occasional cleaning despite being left outdoors year-round​</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I Power Wash My HDPE Adirondack Rocking Chair?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, you can powerwash all of our poly porch rockers and other furniture if needed. <strong>Because of their HDPE construction, our poly rockers naturally resist dirt, grime and environmental elements, making power washing a rarely needed option.</strong> Make sure that the pressure is below 1500 PSI and keep the nozzle at least 12 inches away from your porch rocker​​.</p>
