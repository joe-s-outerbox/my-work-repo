<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 Important Staff Augmentation Best Practices</span></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Clearly Define Job Roles and Expectations</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before seeking and <a href="https://www.sphereinc.com/services/it-staff-augmentation/staff-augmentation-consulting/?engagement_type=TEAM%20AUGMENTATION">onboarding augmented staff</a>, start by identifying the </span><a href="https://sphere.flywheelstaging.com/blogs/staff-augmentation-technical-talent-shortage-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gaps in the knowledge and skills of your existing team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This will ensure that you will be able to identify the most suitable candidate for the position and address all critical expertise gaps that are needed to complete your <a href="https://www.sphereinc.com/services/custom-software-development/?engagement_type=A%20COMPLETE%20TEAM">software development project</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, outline the goals and objectives of the project and your expectations of the staff
    you’re looking to hire. It can be highly beneficial to identify project timelines as well as specific tasks,
    deadlines, and outcomes. If you are struggling with this or have limited time to dedicate to it, consider having adedicated project manager who oversees the progression of the project and helps you with the hiring and onboarding
    of new technology talent.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Maintain Open, Transparent Communication with Augmented Staff Members</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication is one of the top challenges when working with augmented staff. Nonetheless, it’s critical to productivity, can improve project outcomes, and help your team meet deadlines. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a McKinsey report, teams that are well-connected are, on average, </span><a
    href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20-25% more productive</span></a><span
    style="font-weight: 400;">. This also extends to hybrid and remote teams, as their employees are </span><a
    href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/what-employees-are-saying-about-the-future-of-remote-work"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to five times</span></a><span
    style="font-weight: 400;"> more likely to acknowledge being more productive.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to communicating via platforms like Slack, it’s within staff augmentation
    best practices to have regular face-to-face communication via video conferencing tools such as Zoom or Microsoft
    Teams. They can help you improve communication and help build relationships. You can also address issues and
    concerns in real time. </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Utilize Project and Communication Management Tools</span></h3>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-61606 "
    src="https://sphere.flywheelstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/staff-augmentation-best-practices-2-recognition.jpg"
    alt="staff augmentation best practices 2 recognition" width="634" height="373" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Small and medium-sized businesses often allocate resources and management
    responsibilities to a project or team manager. This usually results in optimized project timelines, better adherence
    to timelines and budgets, as well as improved productivity and quality of work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the reasons why project management is so effective is the use of project and
    communication tools. They are especially important if you rely on augmented staff. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Project management tools like Trello, Jira, Asana, and </span><a
    href="https://sphere.flywheelstaging.com/platforms/monday-ps/?engagement_type=monday.com%20Consultation"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monday.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">
    to help keep track of progress and keep the entire team in sync. So, new team members can see exactly what is
    expected of them and what the deadlines are, whereas a project manager or a business leader can effectively track
    progress even if they work with experts in other countries and time zones. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trello tends to be a better option for smaller teams and simpler projects, whereas Jira is more suitable for complex projects, and monday.com is great for both small and large teams.  </span>


<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Document Your Project Processes and Transfer Knowledge</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowledge transfer is vital at any stage of the project and especially so if you work with external staff. Since staff augmentation allows you to scale your team according to demand, it’s crucial that each party involved gains access to all the information they need to adequately complete their job. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, you need to ensure a safe and reliable means of knowledge sharing. This can include training manuals, samples, videos, reports, or other forms of documentation that are relevant to your project. These are some knowledge transfer best practices that can improve your staff augmentation efforts:</span>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A thoroughly outlined process of how
            knowledge should be shared,</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A document management platform such as
            Google Drive where your team can organize and store tacit and explicit knowledge that can be later shared
            with relevant personnel,</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication and project management
            tools such as Slack and Jira to facilitate and document communication and tasks,</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dedicated person, such as the project
            manager, who ensures that knowledge transfer and sharing are effectively performed.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This will guarantee that augmented staff will gain access to all information they need
    to begin work as well as transfer any knowledge and assets once they’ve performed the services required. </span>


<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Stay Involved Throughout the Project Execution Process</span></h3>
<a href="https://sphere.flywheelstaging.com/blogs/how-staff-augmentation-can-drive-results-in-the-wfh-era/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff augmentation</span></a><span
    style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you address specialized needs, and external professionals usually have a
    significant responsibility to ensure a successful project outcome. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, it’s within staff augmentation best practices to stay on track with their
    performance and efficiency. It can make sure that external experts have all the information and assets they need,
    address the right priorities, and meet deadlines and budget requirements. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not have the time and capacity for such involvement, you can also delegate
    this responsibility to a project or team manager. They can serve as a mediator between you and your augmented
    staff. </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Respect Distinct Differences Amongst Your Augmented Staff</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff augmentation allows you to recruit experts from any corner of the globe. This
    means that you and your in-house team may be working with professionals from different cultures, time zones, and
    backgrounds. While external experts may only work for you temporarily, it can improve communication, relationships,
    and overall atmosphere, if you are aware and respectful of these differences. </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Provide Recognition for Your Augmented Employees</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Employee recognition has a direct effect on their </span><a
    href="https://hbr.org/2021/03/research-a-little-recognition-can-provide-a-big-morale-boost" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">morale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, motivation,
    engagement, and productivity. Employees that receive regular appreciation are also more loyal, more satisfied, less
    stressed, and less likely to leave their job prematurely. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if staff augmentation is a temporary solution, recognition can have a direct impact
    on work quality and outcomes. Therefore, don’t shy away from expressing praise and appreciation when it’s due. You
    can share your feedback with your external employee directly as well as with your in-house team in your
    collaboration channels and your staff augmentation provider, as that can impact their future work and
    projects. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you require repeated assistance from the same professional, they are more likely to
    work with you again if they know that they are valued and appreciated.</span>

    alt="staff augmentation best practices 1 project management" width="596" height="397" />
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. Have Confidentiality Terms in Place</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The software development market is fiercely competitive, and your external staff will be
    working on other development projects. Therefore, including confidentiality clauses in the contract with your staff
    augmentation provider can offer your business an extra layer of protection and prevent confidential information,
    trade secrets, and intellectual property from getting into the wrong hands. </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Ensure Easy Project Scalability</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The recruitment process usually takes time, and if you expect that you will need to scale your team up and down, there are some software development and IT staff augmentation tips that can make this process more effective and streamlined:</span>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Select a staff augmentation provider with a wide network of talent,
            various recruiters, and a low attrition rate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Attrition refers to the
            process of the company losing its employees due to a broad range of reasons, and it should optimally be no
            higher than </span><a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/industries-with-the-highest-turnover-rates"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10-15%</span></a><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">. This will ensure that your provider will always have available talent and
            recruiters to assist you.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Agree on the notice period for scaling your team</b><span
            style="font-weight: 400;">. This will help your provider prepare and provide talent without causing project
            delays. </span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Research whether your staff augmentation provider has strong
            employee branding.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Or in other words, their strategy is to be a good place to work. Companies with strong employee branding are more likely to retain talent. Thus, there will be fewer or no issues with them being able to find a good match for your needs. 
             </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. Choose a Reliable and Reputable Staff Augmentation Provider</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last but not least, you need to choose a </span><a
    href="https://sphere.flywheelstaging.com/services/it-staff-augmentation/?engagement_type=TEAM%20AUGMENTATION"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trusted staff augmentation provider</span></a><span
    style="font-weight: 400;"> as the outsourcing market is becoming increasingly more saturated, and bad apples are
    more common. Below are some of the best practices for vetting staff augmentation vendors:</span>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Examine recommendations and reviews:</b><span
            style="font-weight: 400;"> Take into consideration the experience of their prior clients. Have they been
            satisfied with the choice of professionals and recruiting speed? How successful were project outcomes? What
            issues or challenges did they experience, and did the vendor address them?</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Read their </b><a
            href="https://sphere.flywheelstaging.com/insights/portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>case
                studies</b></a><b>:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This can provide insight into how knowledgeable
            and experienced their talent is. What industries and projects have they worked with? What results have they
            helped to achieve? How did they address issues and challenges? </span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Evaluate their work culture—and ensure it matches yours:</b><span
            style="font-weight: 400;"> Finally, make sure that you are comfortable communicating and working with them.
            Schedule introductory calls to determine their values, culture, and terms of collaboration. Do they align
            with your values and working style? What sets them apart? Are they open and transparent? Can you trust them?
            While working with a provider may not be exactly the same as your initial calls, they still can build a
            solid foundation for your future relationship. </span></li>
