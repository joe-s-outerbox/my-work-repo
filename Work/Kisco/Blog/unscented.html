            <p>
                When planning an event, the last thing you want is a guest sneezing or rubbing their eyes because of a scented candle. While a bit of fragrance might seem harmless, many people are more sensitive to scents than you'd expect. In large gatherings, it's hard to predict who might have allergies, asthma, or other sensitivities that can be triggered by strong aromas.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>That's where candles for fragrance sensitivity enter into the picture, ensuring no guest feels uncomfortable or distracted by lingering scents.</strong> They light up the space without adding anything extra to the air, making them ideal for events with a diverse guest list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plus, <strong>venues are increasingly leaning toward odorless candles to meet client demands for allergy-friendly settings.</strong> Whether it's a corporate event, wedding, or charity gala, no one has to worry about overpowering smells clashing with personal sensitivities.

                <p>
                    Ever sat down to a beautifully plated meal only to have the scent of a nearby candle overpower the flavors? Not ideal, right? This is why <a href="https://kiscocandles.com/collections/unscented-candles">unscented candles</a> for events are a must when food is involved. Whether it's a wedding reception, banquet, or corporate dinner, the focus should be on the cuisine, not a competing fragrance. An added bonus of Kisco candles is their dripless feature. Our candles burn for extended periods of time without messy wax drips, keeping the dining experience an enjoyable one. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The benefit of fragrance-free candles lies in their ability to blend effortlessly into the setting without interfering with aromas from the kitchen. No-scent candles for weddings and other celebrations are particularly beneficial, as they allow guests to enjoy every bite of their meal, from the hors d'oeuvres to the dessert, without distraction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Florists also appreciate odorless candles for venues, as they enhance floral arrangements without competing for attention. The result? A cohesive ambiance where every sensory element complements the next — food, flowers, and lighting working in harmony.

                <p>
                    Creating a welcoming environment means considering the needs of every guest. <strong>With people becoming more conscious of allergens and sensitivities, candles for fragrance sensitivity are the way to go.</strong> Scented candles, even with light fragrances, can trigger allergies, headaches, or respiratory issues, making some guests feel uncomfortable or even unwell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By opting for fragrance-free candles for events, planners can ensure that everyone — from guests with asthma to those with fragrance sensitivities — feels safe and included. For weddings, in particular, no-scent candles let every attendee relax and enjoy the moment without worrying about sneezing fits or eye irritation. It's a thoughtful detail that sets the tone for an inclusive, enjoyable experience.
