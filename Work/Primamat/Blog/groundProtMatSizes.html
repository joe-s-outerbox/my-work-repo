            <p><strong>Load-bearing capacity is one of the most important things to consider when picking ground protection mat sizes.</strong> This metric represents how much weight the mat can handle without getting damaged. The size of the mat plays a big part in how well it can spread out the weight of heavy vehicles and equipment. All PrimaMat <a href="https://primamat.com/collections/ground-protection-mats-for-sale">ground protection mats</a> support a robust 50 to 70 tons.</p>

            <p><strong>The type of ground you're working on also affects which mat size you should choose.</strong> Different terrains like muddy, sandy, or uneven areas each have their own challenges. For instance, muddy ground might require larger mats to provide a stable surface and prevent vehicles from sinking. Sandy areas might need mats with a rough texture to avoid slipping, while uneven terrain might require thick mats to protect against sharp edges. Assessing the ground conditions before deciding on the mat size is essential to ensure you get the best performance. PrimaMat ground protection mats are a sturdy 0.75-inch thick, suitable for dealing with any terrain. We also have mats with strong-grip bottoms that don't slip.</p>

                <p><strong>Consider the types of machinery that will be moving around your project site before you choose your ground protection mat sizes.</strong> Check the size of the wheels or tracks on your machines. Your ground protection mats should be wider than the widest wheels or tracks to ensure proper coverage. Because they connect easily, PrimaMat ground mats accommodate any size of equipment.</p>

            <p>Extra-large mats require several people or specialized equipment to wrangle them in place. If you've got a small workforce, huge mats may not be practical. <strong>PrimaMat ground protection mats are an ideal size, weighing less than 100 pounds each.</strong> They're easy for a single person to maneuver and place.</p>

            <p>Huge mats are also hard to store. They're bulky and might not fit in your storage facility. Before purchasing, consider where you'll store the mats when they're not used. <strong>If space is limited, opting for mats that can be easily stacked can save you a lot of hassle.</strong> Additionally, having mats that are easily transported from storage to the site can make your project run much more smoothly. Our ground mats are conveniently sized to fit most storage areas and are easy to transport.</p>
