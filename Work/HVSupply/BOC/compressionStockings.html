        <h3>Types of Medical-Grade Compression Stockings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ankle Socks:</strong> Best suited for those with minor swelling or achy feet, especially after a day of standing or walking. Medical compression socks are a go-to option for athletes seeking to reduce muscle fatigue during short-term physical activities. The light compression is also ideal for beginners new to compression wear.</li>
            <li><strong>Knee-High Stockings:</strong> These are excellent for individuals who experience moderate leg swelling or <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/varicose-veins" target="_blank">varicose veins</a> or have a job that requires long periods of sitting or standing. The moderate compression is beneficial for improving blood flow and minimizing leg fatigue over extended periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Thigh-High Stockings:</strong> Medical compression stockings are recommended for people with more severe symptoms such as significant swelling, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352557" target="_blank">deep vein thrombosis</a> or post-surgical recovery. The higher level of compression provides support not only to the lower legs but also to the thighs, making them a comprehensive option for those in need of more extensive leg coverage.</li>
            <li><strong>Waist-High Stockings:</strong> Providing the most extensive coverage, medical grade compression stockings are similar to tights or pantyhose and are ideal for conditions that affect the entire leg and lower torso. They're often recommended for those with <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8353-lymphedema" target="_blank">lymphedema</a> or significant post-surgical needs. This style is also beneficial for pregnant women seeking full-leg and abdominal support.</li>
