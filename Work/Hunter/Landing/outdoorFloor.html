    With options in various sizes and power levels, each fan meets specific airflow needs, measured in <a href="https://industrialfans.hunterfan.com/blogs/hunter-industrial-blog/how-to-calculate-the-cfm-of-a-fan">CFM (cubic feet per minute)</a>. This measurement reveals how much air each fan moves every minute, helping you choose the perfect fit for your environment.
