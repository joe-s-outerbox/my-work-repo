<p>A large venue demands a fan that can command the space, ensuring every corner is touched by a gentle breeze. The effectiveness of a big outdoor fan is gauged by its size, coverage area and its capacity to move air efficiently:</p>
<div class="list-container">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diameter of the Fan:</strong> Our big outdoor ceiling fans range from 7 feet to 24 feet to suit various needs. </li>
        <li><strong>Coverage Area:</strong> The true test of a fan's efficiency is its ability to cover an extensive area. With our fans, you can expect a coverage area of up to 22,500 square feet, ensuring uniform airflow throughout large venues.</li>
        <li><strong>Airflow Rating (CFM):</strong> The heart of any fan's performance lies in its airflow rating, measured in Cubic Feet per Minute (CFM). </li>
    </ul>
