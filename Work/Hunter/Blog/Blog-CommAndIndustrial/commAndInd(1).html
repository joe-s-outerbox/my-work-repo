        <div class="blog-panel">
            <p>The truth is, the terms “Industrial Fan” and “Commercial Fan” are often used interchangeably. At Hunter Industrial & Commercial, we use the term “Industrial Fan” when referring to our lineup of HVLS (High-Volume, Low-Speed) fans that measure between 7’-24’ in diameter. When we use the term “Commercial Fan,” we are referring to fans like our Trak fan, which is more like the kind of fan you would have in your home, only upgraded to meet the needs of commercial applications. We’ve developed both large and small fans to control the airflow in all the businesses we serve!</p>
