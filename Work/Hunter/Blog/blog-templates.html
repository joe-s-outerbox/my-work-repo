    <h2>LARGE INDUSTRIAL CEILING FANS</h2>
    <p>HVLS fans, or High-Volume, Low-Speed fans, are large ceiling fans designed to move a massive volume of air at low rotational speed. These mechanical fans are typically between 7’ and 24’ in diameter and are designed to provide a cooling effect to large, open spaces like warehouses, factories, and barns. HVLS ceiling fans have been around since the late 1990s, but recent innovations from companies like Hunter Industrial & Commercial have led to a recent increase in popularity.</p>

    <div class="blog-img-wide"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0555/5434/3079/files/image-choose-the-right-industrial-hvls-fan-size.jpg?v=1681394947" alt="" /></div>
    <p>Large industrial ceiling fans are useful year-round. In the hot months, the breeze these big fans produce creates a cooling effect of nearly 10 degrees! <a href="https://industrialfans.hunterfan.com/blogs/hunter-industrial-blog/how-a-cool-environment-leads-to-increased-productivity-as-proven-by-nasa">Studies have shown</a> that once temperatures get into the 80s, workplace productivity starts to drop. HVLS ceiling fans can be the difference between an unsafe, unproductive environment, and an enjoyable workplace. When it is cold outside, HVLS fans aid in <a href="https://industrialfans.hunterfan.com/blogs/hunter-industrial-blog/winter-savings">DESTRATIFICATION</a>, or the mixing of layers of air in an environment. This mixing of air means that the heat trapped at the ceiling of your facility will be distributed evenly.</p>

    <h3>The Difference Between HVLS Fans and Home Ceiling Fans</h3>
    <p>There are two primary differences between HVLS fans and the kind of fan you might have in your living room or bedroom: size and rotational speed. Home ceiling fans are much smaller, spin much faster, and create less airflow than industrial HVLS fans.</p>
    <p>Airflow is measured in cubic feet per minute, or CFM. A standard home ceiling fan generates about 6,700 CFM of airflow set on high. When a 24 ft. <a href="https://industrialfans.hunterfan.com/products/titan-fan">Hunter Titan HVLS fan</a> is set on high, it generates 316,000 CFM of airflow, meaning the Titan HVLS fan is 47 times more powerful than a standard residential ceiling fan!</p>

    <h2>HVLS FAN BENEFITS</h2>
    <p>If your space has large, open ceilings, it will benefit from the installation of HVLS fans. Warehouses are one of the most common applications, where large industrial ceiling fans keep workers safe and product from spoiling. Gyms and other fitness facilities use HVLS fans to keep guests comfortable and handle unpleasant odors. Automotive shops harness the power of HVLS fans to mitigate the unpredictable environment created by open bay doors, and deal with potentially harmful fumes. </p>
