    <h2>How to Circulate Air with Fans</h2>
    <p>Using industrial fans is an effective way to cool a room or space, but it's not just about the type of fan
        you use – it's also about where you place it and how you install it. Proper fan placement can mean the
        difference between a cool, comfortable business space and one that's stuffy and hot. By strategically
        positioning your industrial fan, you will improve air circulation, create a refreshing cross-breeze, and
        maximize its cooling power.</p>
    <p>This article will go over the best fan placement to help you achieve optimal air circulation. We will discuss
        what industrial fans are, the types of businesses that benefit from them, and important things to keep in
        mind before you make a purchase.</p>
    <p>Once we’ve covered how to use fans the right way, we will give you our best advice on what to do next!</p>

        <p>Industrial fans, also known as HVLS (High-Volume, Low-Speed) fans, are large diameter ceiling fans
            capable of generating massive airflow. HVLS fans are popular because they are incredibly inexpensive to
            operate and create a cooling effect of nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit! These huge industrial fans are a
            gamechanger for many businesses where comfort and safety are priorities.</p>

            <p>The HVLS fan blade system generates a large column of air that moves slowly and evenly across the space. The slow movement of the air creates a gentle breeze that circulates throughout the room, creating a more comfortable environment for workers and reducing the temperature stratification that can occur in large spaces.</p>
            <p><strong>To maximize their efficiency, HVLS fans are often used in conjunction with other heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.</strong> By combining HVLS fans with other ventilation systems, it is possible to create a more energy-efficient solution.</p> -->
    </div>
    <h3>Are HVLS Fans Right for You?</h3>
    <p>While industrial ceiling fans improve the environment for almost any business, there are a few basic
        requirements your building must have.</p>
    <p>First off, ceiling height. To properly circulate air, HVLS fans must hang AT LEAST 10 feet off the ground and
        perform best when hanging 20 to 30 feet up. HVLS fans demonstrate acceptable performance when hanging as
        high as 50 feet off the ground but lose effectiveness beyond that. Additionally, there must be at least 25%
        of the fan diameter between the fan blades and the ceiling to ensure proper air circulation.</p>
    <p>The next building consideration to think about is mounting structures. HVLS industrial ceiling fans typically
        need to be mounted on sturdy structures like I-Beams, purlin structures, Unistrut, or glulam beams. These
        large ceiling fans must be mounted on structures that can support double the hanging weight of the fan. This
        is an important consideration when you compare HVLS fans like the <a
            href="https://industrialfans.hunterfan.com/products/titan-fan"></a>, which weighs 204lbs at the largest
        diameter, and the Big Ass Fans Powerfoil X4, which weighs 374lbs at the same diameter.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="blog-body-section" id="ch3">
    <h2>Proper Fan Placement for Safety</h2>
    <p>So, you’ve now ensured that your building can is large and sturdy enough to support HVLS ceiling fans. It’s
        time to think about obstacles. When hanging your HVLS fan, you must make sure to maintain a clearance of at
        least 2 feet between the fan and any light fixture, wall, ductwork, or other potential obstruction. Ideally,
        try not to hang your fan directly below light sources to avoid creating a strobing effect as the blades pass
        through the light. If you have upper walkways or mezzanines in your facility, make sure the fans are out of
        reach, with the blade tips at least 5 feet away.</p>

    <p>If you have a fire sprinkler system, it is important to make sure your HVLS ceiling fan does not interfere
        with its operation. Here are three important rules when it comes to HVLS fans and sprinkler systems:</p>
    <div class="blog-ul">
        <ul>
            <li>Fans should be located at least 3 feet below a sprinkler deflector.</li>
            <li>Fans should be centered between 4 adjacent sprinklers.</li>
            <li>The Industrial Control Panel should be connected to a fire relay system, which can stop the fans in
                the event a fire occurs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It can be difficult to estimate the exact spacing needed for an HVLS fan installation. To make things
            easier, Hunter Industrial & Commercial offers an <a
                href="https://industrialfans.hunterfan.com/blogs/hunter-industrial-blog/ordering-your-industrial-ceiling-fan-just-got-that-much-easier">adjustable
                downrod</a>, which can be lengthened or shortened depending on spacing needs. The adjustable downrod
            takes the guesswork out of fan installation!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-body-section blog-product-section">

                alt="" />
            <p>Next up, make sure your HVLS ceiling fan is not located directly underneath any vertical air discharge,
                like air conditioning systems or evaporative coolers. While these systems work well with HVLS ceiling
                fans, having the fan directly in their discharge area negatively affects fan performance. If you are
                installing multiple HVLS ceiling fans, or adding to a network already in place, consult the owner’s
                manual to ensure the fans are properly spaced apart.

    <h2>Most Effective HVLS Fan Placement</h2>
    <div class="blog-img-wide" style="width: 100%"><img
            src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0555/5434/3079/files/MG_5907b.jpg?v=1684339952" alt="" />
        <p>If you are wondering about fan placement for optimal air circulation, the main thing to keep in mind is to
            concentrate airflow in the areas where employees and guests will be most affected. This location is
            different depending on the industry. Many large grocery stores place their HVLS fans directly above the
            checkout area, where guests and employees tend to cluster. Gyms and fitness centers tend to concentrate
            airflow above areas where visitors are working out. Warehouses often have HVLS fans next to docking areas,
            where open dock doors let in heat and humidity.
        </p>
        <h3>Industrial Fans and Moisture</h3>
        <p>One of the hidden secrets of HVLS fans is their ability to combat the effects of moisture. The airflow
            generated by HVLS fans makes liquid evaporate faster, which reduces the effects of dangerous spills and
            equipment rust. For breweries, gyms, and warehouses with open dock doors, dealing with excess moisture is a
            necessity.</p>
        <h3>Talk to Your Employees</h3>
        <p>This last point may seem obvious, but it is no less important. Speak with your employees and ask them where
            they experience discomfort at work. After all, they are the ones who will be directly affected by the
            increased airflow generated by HVLS fans. They will likely be aware of areas in your business that become
            uncomfortable at different times of the day.</p>

        <div class="blog-panel">
            <p>Fans do not actually lower the temperature of a space, but the airflow generated by fans creates a

                <em>feels</em> cooler. HLVS fans create a cooling effect of up to 10-degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
