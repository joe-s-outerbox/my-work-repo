    <h2>7 Steps to Installing an Industrial Fan</h2>
    <p>For demonstration purposes, we'll discuss how to install <a href="https://industrialfans.hunterfan.com/collections/industrial-hvls-fans">HVLS fans from Hunter Industrial</a>. Naturally, you'll want to follow the instructions that come with your fan, but this will give you an idea of the steps necessary to install an HVLS fan.</p>
    <h3 id="ch1">Step 1: Choose Proper Location to Install HVLS Fans</h3>
    <p>Presumably, you've already done the airflow mapping to determine the placement of your fans. Just to review, your HVLS fan will operate best in open areas where the air can move freely from your ceiling to your floor and outward in every direction. Never place your fan near a wall or other obstruction because this will inhibit the airflow and limit the effective coverage area. Ideally, your HVLS fans should be positioned 20 to 30 feet above the floor, but acceptable performance has been demonstrated as low as 10 feet and as high as 50 feet. Extensions (or "downrods") can be used to achieve the best height for your fans. If you have a facility with an exceptionally tall ceiling, you'll need several fans strategically placed throughout to ensure you get enough air movement.</p>
    <p>Other things to be aware of when planning your fan system:</p>
    <div class="blog-ul">
        <ul>
            <li>Do not mount the fan beneath a light source, which can cause a strobing effect when the fan is operating.</li>
            <li>Be mindful of blade clearances. Don’t install an HVLS fan too close to things like the chains or wires supporting light fixtures – this can create a safety hazard. Blade clearance should be at least 2 feet ’in every direction. </li>
            <li>When routing the fan’s control cable, run it in a conduit or in a way that avoids lighting fixtures to avoid the possibility of signal noise and operational problems.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 id="ch2">Step 2: Safety & Preparation for HVLS Fan Installation</h3>
    <p>Before installing any Hunter fans, mark off the work area, ensure the circuit breaker is turned off, and follow all lockout/tagout procedures are followed.</p>
    <p>Assemble the following tools:</p>
    <div class="blog-ul">
        <ul>
            <li>Ratcheting Wrench Set (Metric)</li>
            <li>Allen Wrench Set (Metric)</li>
            <li>19mm Deep Socket</li>
            <li>Screwdrivers (Phillips & Flathead)</li>
            <li>Tape Measure</li>
            <li>Magnetic Level</li>
            <li>VFD Hardware (if not included)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-img-wide" style="margin-top: 55px;"><img

        alt="" /></div>

    <h3 id="ch3">Step 3: Secure the Industrial Fan Mount</h3>
    <p>To ensure your fan is safe and secure, you need to make sure it has a solid foundation. The following are basic instructions on how to install a ceiling fan mounting. These instructions apply to Hunter XP HVLS fans, which have a rigid mount.</p>
    <p>Assemble the following tools:</p>
    <div class="blog-ul">
        <ul>
            <li>Use a strut channel to span three points of the building structure and create a stable attachment point for your fan.<strong> Don’t install a rigid fan mounting from a single structure such as a purlin, truss, I-beam, or bar joist.</strong></li>
            <li>Bolt the fan mounting plate to the attachment point using the provided hardware. The rigid mount downrod allows up to 33 degrees of adjustment for roof pitch and 5 degrees of adjustment to accommodate an unlevel beam.</li>
            <li>While using the magnetic post level on the downrod to ensure it’s plumb, tighten all 8 locking nuts to 65 foot-pounds.</li>
            <li>Wrap the retention safety cable from the downrod around the beam or building structure.</li>
            <li>Ensure the retention cable length is shorter than the power cable at the motor connection. Coil the excess cable and secure it with the provided clamps.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 id="ch4">Step 4: Install the HVLS Fan Motor</h3>
    <p>Remove the motor from its package, being careful never to lift the motor by the motor power cable. Then proceed with the following steps:</p>
    <p>Assemble the following tools:</p>
    <div class="blog-ul">
        <ul>
            <li>Line up the holes from the retention cable into the fork.</li>
            <li>Insert the clevis pin into the retention rod and secure it with the provided clip.</li>
            <li>Connect the plug from the motor and the downrod. Twist the connector to lock.</li>
            <li>Lift the motor assembly while feeding the studs through the downrod flange.</li>
            <li>Gently feed the excess wire and cable through the top of the downrod.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to pinch the cable between the motor and the downrod flange.</li>
            <li>Secure each stud with the nylon lock nuts.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 id="ch5">Step 5: Industrial Fan Blade Assembly</h3>
    <p>Not all HVLS fan models require this step. The following instructions apply to Hunter ECO/XP blades:</p>
    <div class="blog-ul">
        <ul>
            <li>With the numbers on the blade holder facing up, insert the press studs through the holes in the blade holder.</li>
            <li>Hand screw the nylon lock nuts onto the press studs to hold it in place.</li>
            <li>Tighten the nylon lock nuts on the press studs using the 19mm wrench or socket.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process for the remaining plates.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-img-wide" style="margin-top: 55px;"><img
        src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0555/5434/3079/files/image-how-to-install-big-hvls-ceiling-fans_2.jpg?v=1683564273"
        alt="" /></div>

    <h3 id="ch6">Step 6: Connecting the Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)</h3>
    <p>Now it's time to install the VFD.<strong>Keep in mind that VFD hardware is not usually included, and mounting methods may vary.</strong>  With that said, when installing ceiling fans, here are the typical steps used to connect your VFD:</p>
    <div class="blog-ul">
        <ul>
            <li>Prep the VFD for mounting to the structure.</li>
            <li>Mount the VFD 5 feet outside the blade sweep area.</li>
            <li>Position the VFD with the plug connector panel facing down.</li>
            <li>Connect the motor cable from the fan to the VFD, being careful to align the pins within the connector before performing a clockwise twist to lock it in place. </li>
            <li>Ensure the designated power over ethernet VFD is the lead drive.</li>
            <li>Connect the ethernet communication cable to port Com 1.</li>
            <li>Run the other side of the communication cable to the HMI.</li>
            <li>Plug the VFD power whip into the appropriate power receptacle and twist clockwise to lock.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 id="ch7">Step 7: Installing the HVLS Fan Controls</h3>
    <p>The final step is installing the HVLS fan controller, an electronic or digital fan controller that can easily control the speed, performance, and air circulation of the fan system. For Hunter Industrial Fans, we have designed digital controllers that offer touchscreen interfaces for easy performance controls that help maximize energy efficiency and airflow dynamics of HVLS fans and industrial fan networks.</p>
    <p>To install your fan controller:</p>
    <div class="blog-ul">
        <ul>
            <li>Secure the HVLS fan controller in a convenient location that is easy to access using the provided mounting bracket.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the ethernet cable from the lead drive is connected to the controller.</li>
            <li>Test the controller to ensure that everything is working properly.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="blog-accordion-span"><button class="blog-accordion">What Does a VFD Do?</button>
            <div class="blog-panel">
                <p>A Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is an electrical component that controls the speed and torque of the electric motor that powers a fan. It provides precise control over the fan's speed and, as a result, the airflow rate. By adjusting the voltage and frequency of the electrical power supplied to the motor, a VFD can control the fan's speed and regulate the amount of air moving through the system. This allows for more efficient operation of the fan and can lead to energy savings, along with improved comfort and air quality in your building.</p>
