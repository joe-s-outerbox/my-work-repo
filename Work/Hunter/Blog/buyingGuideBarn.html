<h2>Ceiling Fans for Large Barns Combat Heat Stress and Other Conditions</h2>

        <strong>Moderate to severe animal heat stress occurs when temperatures range from 80°F to 90°F with high humidity levels.</strong> According to the USA Regenerative Agricultural Alliance, Inc. (<a href="https://usaregenalliance.org/blog/heat-stress-in-livestock-recognition-mitigation-and-prevention" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">USARA</a>), this can cause significant physiological stress to your animals, leading to increased respiration rates and body temperatures. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Heat stress in dairy cattle may lead to <a href="https://extension.umn.edu/dairy-milking-cows/heat-stress-dairy-cattle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">decreased feed intake, lower milk production, and reproductive issues</a>. <strong>For instance, a cow's milk production can decrease by up to 2.5 pounds per head per day under mild heat stress and by more than 10 pounds per head per day under severe heat stress.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Other conditions brought on by poorly circulated air include the buildup of harmful gasses like ammonia and environmental factors such as dust, humidity, and temperature fluctuations. And let's not forget about the flies and other pests that can stress out your animals.
    </p>
    <p>
        The solution is installing industrial fans for barns. <strong><a href="/collections/industrial-hvls-fans">HVLS ceiling fans</a> and other air circulators provide a healthy, quiet, comfortable environment for your animals to thrive in.</strong>

    <h2>Best Barn Ceiling Fans</h2>
    <p>
        Configuring your barn for the best airflow coverage will depend on several factors, such as the size of your building, the number of animals it houses, and whether you have one large open space or several small areas that need to be covered. Fortunately, there are several solutions to ensure you provide the best environment for your livestock.
    </p>
