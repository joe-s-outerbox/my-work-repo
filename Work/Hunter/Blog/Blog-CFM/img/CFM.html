    <h2>What are Industrial Fans?</h2>
    <p>First off, let’s discuss what industrial ceiling fans are. Industrial ceiling fans are large diameter fans, commonly known as High-Volume, Low Speed (HVLS) fans, that move a tremendous amount of air at low rotational speed. These large fans are very cost-efficient to operate and make your business space feel up to 10°F cooler. This cooling effect contributes directly to energy savings, employee retention, and an overall safer, more comfortable working environment.</a>.

    <p>So, what sets one HVLS fan apart from another? And how do you know if a certain fan is right for you? The truth is, there are many factors to consider (we will get into some of those later), but one easy metric to know is the fan’s CFM number, which lets you gauge how powerful a fan is. This number tells you how much air the fan can move in a given period of time. For reference, let’s take the Hunter Original, a residential ceiling fan you might find in your living room or bedroom. This fan can generate 6,716 CFM of airflow at high speed, which is more than sufficient for your house. On the other hand, look at the Hunter Titan HVLS ceiling fan, which measures 24 feet in diameter at the largest size. At high speed, this fan generates 316,000 cubic feet per minute of airflow!</p>

    <h3>Air Changes Per Hour</h3>
    <p>Why does all this matter? Well, to maintain a safe, comfortable environment, it is important for the air inside a room to be regularly exchanged to not get stuffy and stagnant. The concept of using ventilation and airflow to change the air inside an area is measured in Air Changes Per Hour, or ACH. To know how what ACH rate is necessary for different environments, we look to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). ASHRAE recommends that residential homes need .35 Air Changes Per House, and warehouses, depending on their size, need between 6 and 30! Small ceiling fans simply will not deliver the cooling effect you need in your industrial or commercial setting.

    <h2>How to Calculate CFM of a Fan</h2>
        <p>Calculating the CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) of an industrial fan is similar to calculating it for any other fan, but it's often the case that industrial fans are more powerful and used in applications that require a higher volume of air to be moved. Here are steps to calculate the CFM of an industrial fan:</p>
        <div class="blog-ul">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Check Manufacturer's Data:</strong> Often, the manufacturer will provide the CFM rating or other airflow specifications of the industrial fan. Check the product manual, specifications sheet, or label on the fan.</li>
                <li><strong>Measure Airflow Speed:</strong> If the manufacturer's data is not available, you will need to measure the speed at which the air is flowing through the fan. Use an anemometer to measure this speed in feet per minute (FPM).</li>
                <li><strong>Measure Outlet Area:</strong> Determine the cross-sectional area of the fan’s outlet in square feet. For a circular outlet, the area is π times the radius squared (πr²). For a rectangular or square outlet, the area is length times width (L x W).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
            <p>Here’s how you can calculate the CFM of a fan:</p>
        <div class="blog-ul">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Know the Formula:</strong> CFM = (Fan's airflow speed in feet per minute) x (Area of the fan's outlet in square feet)</li>
                <li><strong>Measure Airflow Speed:</strong> Measure the speed at which air is flowing through the fan. This can be measured using an anemometer. Note the speed in feet per minute (FPM).</li>
                <li><strong>Measure the Outlet Area:</strong> Measure the area of the fan’s outlet, which is usually where the air exits the fan. If the fan's outlet is circular, you can calculate the area using the formula for the area of a circle (Area = π x r^2, where r is the radius of the circle). If it's a rectangular outlet, use the formula (Area = length x width). Convert the area into square feet if it’s not already.</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate CFM:</strong> Plug the values you obtained into the formula and calculate the CFM.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
            <p>CFM = Airflow Speed (FPM) x Area of Fan's Outlet (sq ft)</p>
            <p>Note that sometimes you can find the airflow speed or CFM rating specified by the manufacturer on the fan’s documentation or label.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, if the fan’s performance is documented in different units, you may have to convert them into CFM:</p>
        <div class="blog-ul non-italic">
            <ul>
                <li>If you have the airflow in cubic meters per hour (m³/h), convert it to CFM by dividing it by 1.699 (CFM = m³/h / 1.699).</li>
                <li>If you have the airflow in liters per second (L/s), convert it to CFM by multiplying it by 2.119 (CFM = L/s x 2.119).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Make sure you use consistent units throughout the calculations and always verify if the manufacturer has provided data you can use directly.</p>
        <h3>Example For How To Calculate The CFM Of A Fan</h3>
        <p><a href="https://industrialfans.hunterfan.com/collections/industrial-hvls-fans">High Volume Low Speed (HVLS) fans</a> are designed to move large volumes of air at low speeds. They are often used in large spaces such as warehouses or industrial facilities. Let's calculate the CFM of a 24-foot HVLS fan.</p>
        <p>In this example, let's say that Hunter specifies that the fan runs at an average speed of 60 RPM (rotations per minute), and the average airflow speed generated by the fan is 300 feet per minute (FPM).</p>
        <div class="blog-ul">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Measure the Outlet Area:</strong> First, we need to find the area of the fan's outlet. Since the fan is circular, we will use the formula for the area of a circle:
                    <br>Area = π x r² The radius of the fan is half the diameter, so in this case, the radius is 24 feet / 2 = 12 feet.
                    <br>Area = π x (12 ft)² ≈ 3.14 x 144 sq ft ≈ 452.16 sq ft</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate CFM:</strong>Now we can calculate the CFM using the formula:
                <br>CFM = Airflow Speed (FPM) x Area of Fan's Outlet (sq ft)
                <br>CFM = 300 FPM x 452.16 sq ft ≈ 135,648 CFM</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>So, this 24-foot HVLS fan would have an approximate airflow of 135,648 CFM.</p>
        <p>It’s important to note that this example is hypothetical and the numbers are for illustration purposes. In practice, the airflow speed, RPM, and other factors could be different. It’s always recommended to refer to Hunter’s data for the most accurate information. Also, the performance may vary depending on the installation, environmental conditions, and other factors.

    <h2>AMCA Certified HVLS Fans</h2>
    <div class="blog-img-wide" style="width: 100%;"><img
            src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0555/5434/3079/files/Dairy_Farm_04f50c22-50c2-4208-9787-08ddaa192e23.jpg?v=1687374031"
            style="width: 100%;" alt="AMCA Certified HVLS Fans" />
        <p>So now you know that CFM is used to measure how much air a fan is capable of moving, but how do you trust the numbers that an industrial fan manufacturer advertises? If the testing must be done in a special lab, how do you know if the numbers are accurate? The truth is, when measuring CFM, it is easy to make the airflow seem more impressive by testing right next to the fan blades. But that reading is not helpful considering that HVLS fans are usually hung 20-30 off the ground.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, this is where third party verification comes in. The Air Movement and Control Association (AMCA) is one of the most highly regarded international, not-for-profit organizations in the air movement and control industry. If an HVLS fan is AMCA Certified, it means that the numbers advertised reflect the actual capabilities of the fan. In the scenario outlined above, this means that the CFM measurement was taken at floor level, rather than right next to the fan blades, and more accurately, reflects the fan’s capabilities.

        <h3>AMCA Accredited Laboratories</h3>
        <p>So, what about the HVLS fan laboratories we’ve mentioned a few times? These obviously need to be state-of-the-art facilities staffed by airflow experts. But AMCA also offers a program to third-party accredit the lab itself. If a fan is engineered and tested in an AMCA certified laboratory, it adds another level of certainty. There are only a handful of AMCA accredited HVLS fan laboratories in the country, one of which is located at the Hunter Industrial & Commercial headquarters in Smyrna, TN.
