    <h2>Finding the Best Industrial Ceiling Fan</h2>
    <p>HVLS fans are designed to help improve air circulation, reduce the effects of humidity, and maintain a consistent
        environment throughout your space. With a variety of sizes, styles, and features available, choosing the right
        HVLS fan is a challenging task. This article will act as a high-level buying guide, going over key
        considerations, including the size of the space, ceiling height, airflow performance, energy efficiency, fan
        size, cost, durability, etc. We'll highlight and link to various Hunter Industrial & Commercial informational
        pages throughout.</p>

        <p>The term “HVLS” stands for High-Volume, Low-Speed. HVLS fans are huge, with some measuring as much as 24 feet
            in diameter, and move a tremendous amount of air. These large industrial ceiling fans create a cooling
            effect of nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit and generate airflow throughout a large area. In the colder months,
            these large ceiling fans effectively mix the layers of air in your facility through a process called
            “Destratification,” which helps to redistribute heat. Using HVLS fans decreases the burden on your HVAC
            system and can lead to an energy savings of up to 30%!</p>

                HVLS fans?</a></p>
        <h3>Ideal Industries for HVLS Fans</h3>
        <p>A wide variety of businesses make use of HVLS ceiling fans. If you have tall ceilings and prioritize comfort
            and safety, HVLS fans are right for you! Here are just a few of the common settings where you will find HVLS
            industrial ceiling fans:</p>

        <div class="blog-ul">
            <ul>
                <li>Warehouses and Factories</li>
                <li>Dairy Barns</li>
                <li>Gymnasiums</li>

    <p><strong>Are HVLS fans right for you? Here are a few things to consider before you purchase.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="blog-body-section blog-product-section" id="ch3">
    <h2>Building Requirements for HVLS Fans</h2>
    <p>The first question that needs answered is, how large is your space? Industrial HVLS ceiling fans are available in
        a large range of sizes, from 7 feet all the way up to 24 feet in diameter. Even the smaller fan options are
        powerful though, with the Hunter XP fan having a maximum affected area of 1,225 square feet. On the other end of
        the spectrum, 24-foot fans, like the Hunter Titan, have a maximum affected area of 22,500 square feet. Depending
        on the size of your space, multiple industrial ceiling fans may be necessary. HVLS ceiling fans must hang AT
        LEAST 10 feet off the ground, and the fans perform best when hanging between 20 and 30 feet up.</p>
    <div class="blog-img-wide" style="width: 100%"><img
            src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0555/5434/3079/files/3.jpg?v=1684347377" style="width: 100%"
            alt="" />
        <h3>HVLS Fan Mounting Structures</h3>
        <p>Next, you need to consider if you have the proper mounting structure for HVLS ceiling fans. HVLS fans need to
            be mounted on sturdy structures that can withstand roughly twice the maximum hanging weight of the fan.
            These mounting structures include I-beams, purlin structures, Unistrut, and glulam beams. This usually isn’t
            an issue, as most industrial spaces are designed with these sorts of materials. However, some fans are
            heavier than others, so it is important to ensure that your space is sturdy enough to support the weight.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, you must make sure your HVLS ceiling fan is installed with enough clearance from any obstacles.
            This means the fan must be at least 2 feet away from any lighting fixtures, and 5 feet out of reaching
            distance from walkways or mezzanines.</p>

        <p>Not all HVLS fans are the same. Now that you have discovered if you have the right space for large diameter
            ceiling fans, let’s go over a few things that set some HVLS fans apart.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Learn More: </strong><a class="blog-learn-more"

                Benefits for Warehouses</a></p>
        <h3>HVLS Fan Price and Performance</h3>
        <p>As is commonplace with most large, industrial equipment manufacturers, most companies require customers to <a
                href="https://industrialfans.hunterfan.com/pages/get-a-quote">get a quote</a> to find specific HVLS fan
            pricing. That way, they can learn more about your specific needs to ensure they recommend the correct
            product.<strong>Hunter HVLS ceiling fans are extremely affordable when compared to other leading brands, and
                the benefits of going with Hunter are unmatched.</strong> (More on that later.) </p>
        <p>It is also important to consider HVLS fan performance. HVLS fan performance is measured in CFM, which stands
            for Cubic Feet per Minute. This is basically a way of measuring how much air is being pushed through the fan
            in a set period. The Hunter Titan HVLS fan is capable of moving air at rate of 316,000 cubic feet per
            minute, which is 47 times as powerful as the average home ceiling fan!</p>
        <h3>HVLS Fan Durability and Warranty</h3>
        <p>Is the HVLS fan you are considering built to stand the test of time? Some manufacturers still use outdated
            technology, like gear-box motors that can leak oil! Hunter HVLS fans are designed with oil-free direct drive
            motors, and the blades are constructed with air-craft grade materials and redundant safety systems. We are
            the only HVLS manufacturer to offer an Adjustable Downrod, which takes the guesswork out of ordering and
            installing your fan.</p>
        <p>Are you worried about accidentally hitting your fan with a fork truck? Don’t worry, we’ve already tested that
            for you:</p>

        <p>In fact,<strong> we are so confident in our HVLS products that we offer a Limited Lifetime Warranty on our
                Titan, ECO, and XP models.</strong> That is the best HVLS fan warranty around!</p>
        <h3>Lead Times and Support</h3>
        <p>These days, it is difficult for industrial suppliers to keep their warehouses fully stocked. Before you place
            your HVLS fan order, make sure you know exactly how long it will take before the fans arrive at your
            warehouses. The last thing you want is to place your order, thinking you will have the fans before it gets
            too hot, only to discover it will take weeks or months for the fans to even leave the warehouse.<strong>
                With Hunter Industrial & Commercial, you can rest assured knowing that we offer 10 DAY LEAD
                TIMES!</strong> We will get the air flowing when you need it!
