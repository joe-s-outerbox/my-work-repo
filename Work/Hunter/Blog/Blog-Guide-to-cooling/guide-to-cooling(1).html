    <h2> How to Make Your Warehouse Less Hot</h2>
    <p>Summer is right around the corner, and, in many areas of the country,
        temperatures are starting to rise! The last couple of years have seen some of
        the hottest summers on record, and there is no reason to think this year will
        be any different. For your employees, rising warehouse temperatures means
        discomfort, decreased output, and, worst of all, hazardous working
        conditions. If you are looking for large warehouse cooling options, read on!
        </p>
        <h3>Ideal Warehouse Temperature</h3>
        <p>According to OSHA, the ideal workplace temperature range is between 68-
            76°F. If the temperature rises above 76°F, strenuous work (like what your
            employees are tasked with) potentially becomes unsafe. And that is just for
            workers who have been properly acclimatized to hot working conditions. For
            unacclimatized workers, like those you hired in the last couple of weeks,
            even temperatures in the high 70’s carry a high risk of heat-related illness. </p>
            <p>This is troubling news for warehouse owners, where the working environment
                is difficult to manage. Open dock doors, high ceilings, and industrial
                machinery all contribute to hot, humid working conditions. It is all too easy
                for your warehouse temperature to soar into the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88nv7g/amazon-workers-describe-excessive-heat-fainting-in-nyc-warehouse">80’s</a> and <a href="https://www.sbsun.com/2022/09/16/amazons-air-freight-workers-document-hot-conditions-inside-warehouse/">90’s</a>, creating
                hazardous working conditions.</p>

        <h2 class="tight"> Summer Warehouse Cooling Guide </h2>
        <div class="blog-img-wide"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0555/5434/3079/files/image-choose-the-right-industrial-hvls-fan-size.jpg?v=1681394947" alt="" />
            <p>The good news is, there is hope! Cooling a warehouse without AC is possible.
                In this article, we will discuss practical ways to make your warehouse safe for
                workers all summer long. Not only will your employees be more comfortable
                and productive, but some of these options will generate year-round energy
                savings as well!</p>
            <h3 id="vent">Ventilation</h3>
            <p>Remove the excess heat from your facility by airing out your workspace
                overnight. If you are in an area where the days are hot, but the nights are
                cool, take advantage of the fresh air by opening dock doors and windows
                wherever possible. This essentially re-sets your business, so the temperature
                is more pleasant the following morning. Installing screen doors and windows
                will help to eliminate pests and using air circulating fans (more on those
                later!) will speed up the process.
                </p>
            <p>Of course, this option isn’t practical for all facilities, especially those that are
                not staffed overnight. But for many, warehouse ventilation will refresh your
                workspace. 
                </p>
                <h3 id="ins">Insulation</h3>
                <p>Insulate your warehouse space wherever possible. Doors, walls, roofs… the
                    more insulation, the better. This traps in cool air during the summer and
                    makes it more difficult for the hot outside air to penetrate into your space.
                    This has the added benefit of making it easier to keep your warehouse warm
                    in the winter.</p>

                <h3 id="hyd">Hydration</h3>
                <p>This is a simple one, but incredibly important. Make sure your employees are
                    drinking plenty of water! <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/userfiles/works/pdfs/2017-126.pdf">According to the CDC</a>, when working in the heat,
                    you should drink one cup of water every 15-20 minutes. Allow water breaks
                    whenever possible, and make sure water is easily accessible for all employees. 
                    When it is going to be a hot day, encourage your employees to
                    hydrate BEFORE work begins. Remember: by the time you feel thirsty, you
                    are already behind in water consumption.

                <h3 id="PEC">Portable Evaporative Coolers</h3>
                <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0555/5434/3079/files/image-calculate_cfm-airflow-industrial-hvls-fans_3399936e-f150-4cdb-ba8d-48fc6d0a794f.jpg?v=1681760249" alt="">
                <p>Portable evaporative coolers are essentially mini air conditioners that you
                    can move around your facility. The coolers work by pulling air through a wet
                    medium, which acts to remove the heat, and then blowing the chilled air
                    back out into your facility. These evaporative coolers can be small enough
                    for one individual workstation, or large enough to cool an open industrial
                    space. The downside is that these large units are expensive, inefficient and,
                    if not maintained properly, could clog and create unpleasant odors. </p>

                <h3 id="ceiling">HVLS Ceiling Fans</h3>
                <p>Large diameter industrial fans are one of the most practical and efficient
                    warehouse cooling solutions. These warehouse cooling fans are known as
                    <a href="https://industrialfans.hunterfan.com/blogs/hunter-industrial-blog/what-are-hvls-fans">High-Volume, Low-Speed (HVLS) fans,</a> 
                    and they are engineered to move A
                    LOT of air throughout your workspace. Now, technically speaking, these fans
                    don’t lower the temperature of your warehouse. What they do, however, is
                    generate a COOLING EFFECT, which makes your employees feel like it is up
                    to 10°F cooler! HVLS ceiling fans cost just pennies an hour to operate and
                    generate energy savings all year long.</p>
                <h3 id="circ">Air Circulators</h3>
                <p>Industrial air circulators are warehouse cooling fans that deliver powerful,
                    reliable airflow wherever you need it most in your warehouse. Whereas HVLS 
                    fans move air all throughout your facility, industrial air circulating fans are
                    crafted to provide a cooling effect in a specific area or workspace. Many
                    businesses use HVLS fans and air circulating fans in tandem to cool a
                    warehouse without AC. </p>

    <div class="blog-accordion-span"><button class="blog-accordion"><h3> What is the best temperature for a warehouse?</h3></button>
    <div class="blog-panel">
    <p>The ideal working temperature for a warehouse in the

    <div class="blog-accordion-span"><button class="blog-accordion"><h3> Can HVLS fans be used in the winter?</h3></button>
    <div class="blog-panel">
    <p>Yes. HVLS ceiling fans redistribute the hot air trapped at the

    <div class="blog-accordion-span"><button class="blog-accordion"><h3>Are there OSHA requirements for warehouse temperature?</h3></button>
    <div class="blog-panel">
    <p> OSHA does not have a specific required temperature for
        warehouses. However, they do require that your workspace remains “free
        from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or
        serious physical harm. Their suggested temperature range is between 68-
        76°F.

        <div class="blog-panel">
        <p>When it comes to industrial ceiling fans, destratification refers
            to the mixing of layers of air within a space. Industrial ceiling fans create a
