<p>The months are getting warmer and this means heat stress among cattle is increasing. Heat stress can do serious damage to cattle including increased dehydration, decreased feed intake, decreased milk production, and other lasting health problems. <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/heat_stress_in_dairy_cattle">Experts estimate heat stress causes $5 to $6 billion in lost milk production and decreased animal performance in the United States each year.</a></p>

<p>Compared to other mammals, dairy cows are the most likely to fall victim to heat stress due to <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/heat_stress_in_dairy_cattle">fermentation in the rumen.</a> Likewise, cattle that spend more time in a confined area versus roaming pastures will also be more susceptible to heat stress and dehydration. Pastured cattle have a larger opportunity to seek shade, water supplies, and create air movement to cool themselves.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">One of the best and most efficient ways to keep your cattle cool during the summer and reduce the effects of heat stress, is to place HVLS fans throughout your farm. Many farmers default to traditional low velocity, high speed fans which in return dramatically increases the electricity bill. (One HVLS replaces the equivalent of multiple small fans.) In addition, low velocity fans only mobilize air within a few feet from the fan resulting in limited cooling and often increased heat caused from cattle huddling together near the fans.</p>

<h2><strong>Why your livestock need HVLS fans.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Air movement affects both convective and evaporative heat losses, making it a vital factor in preventing heat stress. To keep your budget low and your <a href="/pages/livestock-fans">livestock</a> cool, HVLS is the way to go. HVLS fans distribute large amounts of air at a lower rotation speed resulting in the ability to keep your barn feeling cool. Cattle-wise, this will help avoid heat stress, maintain ideal milk production, and even keep bugs and birds from flooding the facility.</p>
<p>Budget-wise,  HVLS  fans  will  greatly  cut  down  on%   air  maintenance    only  costing  pennies  a  day  to  run.  Keep  in  mind:  without  proper  air  movement%   cattle  can  fall  prey  to  heat  stress,  and  dehydration  resulting  in  increased  hydration  costs  and  potential  loss  of  life.  (That%E2%80%99s  worth  much  more  than  a  few  pennies!)</p>

<p>“I was impressed by the few parts needed to put Hunter’s fans together, and I’ve been even more pleased by how low maintenance the fans have been since installation,” said Sjouke Plantinga, “The fans’ direct drive motor also ensures no oil leaks down on the cows, which is a major issue with fans using more traditional motors.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By using Hunter’s HVLS fans in his barn as opposed to the 60 box fans Plantinga estimates his electricity bill has been cut by close to 80 percent. “The efficiency and low wattage of Hunter’s fans has been a huge cost saver for me,” said Mr. Plantinga. “I hope to be able to work with Hunter for additional barn needs in the future.”<a href="#_msocom_3">[</a></p>
