            <li>Run ragged by your “vanilla” life (work, kids, and family obligations) which made you put your needs on the back burner.</li>

                <p>When my Dominant and I were first starting out, there was nothing available online to help us step-by-step on our journey. We were privileged to live in one of the kinkiest cities on the planet: San Francisco, California.</p>
                <p>Although we had access to in-person classes, mentors, and communities, we know everyone isn’t as lucky. Learning about and practicing BDSM can be very taboo; we aim to take the stigma out of it and teach people sane, safe, and sexy ways to explore the lifestyle.</p>
                <p>This lifestyle is life-changing, but rife with red flags. I’ve witnessed people make huge mistakes, which comes with serious physical, mental, and emotional risks. As a professional BDSM instructor and Dom/sub coach, I want to help others on their journey. I also enjoy being a submissive in a successful 24/7 relationship, which has become one of the most powerful decisions I’ve made in my life.</p>
                <p>So even if you’re new to BDSM or have no idea where to begin, “Dom Sub Training” will become your step-by-step system for living a satisfying 24/7 lifestyle.</p>
