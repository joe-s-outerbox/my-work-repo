<p>At OuterBox, we see a lot of eCommerce brands and websites. We run a TON of tests. <strong>To help you in your
        growth, we wanted to summarize some of our favorite eCommerce conversion hacks to assist you in making your site
        more effective.</strong> We hope you take away a variety of new optimization and eCommerce feature enhancements.
</p>
<div id="long-blog">
    <h2 id="experimenting-with-cart-addition">1. Experimenting With “Cart-Addition” </h2>
    <p>More carts equals more growth. <strong>When looking to increase the volume of cart additions within your
            e-commerce experience, tweaking the add-to-cart process is a key aspect of improving your overall conversion
            rate.</strong></p>
    <p>Your store likely takes a user directly to the cart page after an add-to-cart action has been taken. You may want
        to test an alternative approach, by skipping the cart page entirely and further guiding the user down the
        checkout path directly (right to the page).</p>
    <p>Another option is to use an overlay modal. This approach allows the user to jump right into checkout, versus
        having to go through the additional step of the shopping cart page. We have seen conversion rate increases
        exceed 25% by instituting this type of practice.</p>

    <h2 id="progression-rate-monitoring">2. Progression Rate Monitoring</h2>
    <p>Want to maximize your site potential and market opportunity?</p>
    <p>If so, your e-commerce store needs to have an up-to-date pulse on a daily basis on all sections of the user
        experience. <strong>Your brand needs to identify immediately what sections or experience types are
            under-performing.</strong></p>
    <p>By only reviewing your conversion rate and not your page-level micro-conversion rate, i.e. the percentages that
        make up the paths in your merchandising pages, you are missing the granular details that define where your
        experience is broken or under-performing.</p>
    <p>Progression monitoring enables marketers to have a clear understanding of website opportunities, primarily using
        Google Analytics and their associated API functionality.</p>

    <h2 id="dynamic-overlays">3. Dynamic Overlays</h2>
    <p>Although sometimes seen as annoying and potentially distracting to an online experience, overlay modals have
        proven to be effective in capturing email addresses and encouraging users to opt in to utilize promotional
        codes.</p>
    <p>We recommend utilizing modals in a fashion which they are tailored to the clickstream path and behavior of the
        web user.</p>
    <p>Either within exit intent scenarios or within timed “page depth release rules,” overlays should be targeted with
        promotions that correlate to categories viewed or to the shipping value proposition (ex. Give email for flat
        rate $3.00 shipping code).</p>
    <p>For example, if a shopper is shopping for grills on HomeDepot.com, the user will be shown a home and garden
        category coupon in exchange for email sign-up.</p>
    <p>The e-commerce business captures the email address, emails the coupon to the user (or shows it immediately) and
        provides a great chance for that user to utilize a coupon in the process of the sale.</p>
    <h2 id="geo-specific-messaging">4. Geo-Specific Messaging</h2>
    <p><strong>A great way to capture the interest of the user upon arriving at your store is to present geo-specific
            messaging that relates to their hometown location where they are based.
        </strong></p>
    <p>By utilizing IP addresses of web traffic, a website can present both weather-related merchandise promotions as
        well
        as shipping messaging that speaks to the timeframe for which a package would reach a local destination.</p>
    <p>Many retailers do a great job in utilizing this type of geo-specific messaging with the free shipping promotion
        they
        already serve. For example, if I came to a website from my hometown of Philadelphia, I would see “We ship free
        to
        Pennsylvania” as a core creative that is dynamically tailored within the homepage.</p>

    <h2 id="trust-badges">5. Trust Badges</h2>
    <p><strong>Trust badges are another simple way to improve progression rates within your checkout process, without
            having
            to reconstruct or redesign your actual pages.</strong></p>
    <p>Consumers respond very positively to the insertion of a Trusted Provider logo, as a significant subset of Web
        shoppers still feel somewhat uneasy with utilizing credit card data online.</p>
    <p>Trust badging companies scan your site on a daily basis and provide a dynamic badge that is embedded within your
        checkout process and showing the extended level of trust to your shoppers. Gains from this type of solution can
        vary, at the low end you may see a 1 to 2% increase in conversion rate with in some instances we have seen
        companies
        experience 6 to 10% increases.</p>

    <h2 id="additional-payment-methods">6. Additional Payment Methods</h2>
    <p>Additional payment functionality is another way to provide a more effective checkout experience. In this
        instance, it
        comes down to convenience. Additional payment options speed up transactions and relieve shoppers from entering
        credit card and ship details.</p>

    <p>PayPal provides convenience to the shopper, is easy for reconciliation due to pre-built accounting integrations
        and
        often shoppers already have an existing balance that can be utilized for purchase at your store (reducing buying
        friction).</p>

    <p>Other payment options from Visa and from Apple also exist but we recommend primarily utilizing PayPal within your
        current gateway and e-commerce platform.</p>

    <h2 id="auto-populating-city-and-state">7. Auto-Populating City and State </h2>
    <p>The “new customer” e-commerce process for a consumer is a headache. Nobody likes filling out fields and creating
        accounts. <strong>The more you can make it easier the better off you (and your conversion rate) will
            be.</strong></p>

    <p>A great example is a small change that can drive a big impact is to auto-populate state and city information
        after a user enters in a zip code within a checkout form. Within a test at OuterBox, utilizing an API connection
        that populated this address data upon zip code population, this strategic page enhancement drove an 8%
        page-level conversion increase which equaled hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue annualized.</p>

    <h2 id="form-analytics">8. Form Analytics</h2>
    <p>Nearly every Internet business uses web analytics to measure results, but very few use form analytics to gauge
        the progression of users within specific fields outlined in a given form (ex. Billing info in Checkout).</p>

    <p>Within any business category in which the user must provide information relating to the purchase, be it credit
        card information, address information and so forth, it is critical to understand how far users go in the
        process. Through this intelligence, you can begin to test form field presentations to see what works best.</p>

    <p>In certain instances, your business may be able to reduce the number of fields in your form and/or tweak the size
        of the form and layout/presentation to have a greater ratio of completion.</p>

    <h2 id="save-for-later">9. Save for Later</h2>
    <p>Save for later functionality is a critical aspect of enabling users to not lose progress from on-site research
        that has been conducted. Not everyone is ready to buy now, in fact, most aren’t.</p>

    <p>Many times, shoppers on your website are reviewing your models and pricing information, but yet aren’t ready to
        buy until conducting further research in the industry.</p>

    <p>Empower them with the tools to save their progress within your domain under a user ID and gain their email
        address from the registration process. This will enable your business to market to them in the future,
        preferably on an automated sequence to ultimately close the sale.</p>

    <h2 id="exit-information">10. Exit Interruption</h2>
    <strong>
        <p>Love it or hate it, exit interruption technology has become an effective way for brands to gather email
            addresses and derive value from otherwise lost sessions.</p>
    </strong>

    <p>In these instances, users are leaving your site anyway, so by generating a pop-up triggered by mouse velocity and
        browser pixel thresholds, your site can gain value from otherwise lost sessions.</p>

    <p>The key to interruption technology is to make messaging and creativity align to the interests/clickstream of the
        user, i.e. what they have shown on your website (as discussed earlier).</p>

    <p>For example, if your user went to the bicycle category under your outdoor store, and ultimately shows a
        propensity to leave, upon leaving show them a free shipping coupon code for bikes or potentially a video series
        to help them find and purchase the best bike for their needs (for an email address).</p>

    <h2 id="abandoned-cart-emails">11. Abandoned Cart Emails</h2>
    <p><strong>Abandoned cart emails are another effective way to ensure that your business takes as many steps as
            possible to re-engage customers.</strong> Within this use case, your eCommerce system sends a tailored email
        message to the website visitor, assuming they were logged in, and emails the cart contents to the user,
        typically with a promotion.</p>

    <p>Abandoned cart emails can also be deployed in situations in which a user is not logged in. In this case, the
        email address should be the first form field within the checkout page. If the user abandons after filling out
        the first initial field, the system can still deliver the abandoned cart email with the associated product and
        related offer using the magic of Javascript.</p>

    <p>Retailers frequently disagree about when the best time to send an abandoned cart email is, but most of our
        customers send the email approximately 12 to 24 hours after the abandonment takes place. This time duration has
        proven to be an effective timeframe for which to release.</p>


    <h2 id="test-free-shipping-thresholds">12. Test Free Shipping Thresholds</h2>
    <p>Every retailer uses free shipping as a mechanism to drive growth, especially during peak seasons in which
        conversions are at their highest.</p>

    <strong>
        <p>During the off-season, however, free shipping cannot be a sustainable part of an online strategy, but yet
            should be considered as a tool to strategically help people to convert.</p>
    </strong>

    <p>The question is what average threshold, in terms of dollar amounts, do your customers respond best to? This
        informational intelligence can only be gathered from testing thresholds.</p>

    <p>Start with typical ranges of $50-$75 to trigger free shipping and observe the impact on your overall profit and
        loss, you will see with those minimums the right balance to maximize your logistical economic opportunity.</p>

    <h2 id="infinite-scroll">13. Infinite Scroll</h2>
    <p><strong>Infinite Scroll is a fantastic mechanism to enable users to view an endless supply of products without
            having to engage in pagination clicks, clicks that would increase the chances of a user abandoning your
            website.</strong></p>

    <p>Essentially, infinite Scroll uses JavaScript and related technologies, to consistently deliver products within a
        merchandising grid-type environment, until that complete list of products reaches its conclusion.</p>

    <p>Be aware that this technology could present potential problems with search engine optimization and brands should
        utilize canonical tags and/or prev next tags to ensure that search engines and crawlers have visibility into
        which pages should be served.</p>

    <h2 id="product-badging">14. Product Badging</h2>
    <p><strong>Product badging is another great way to distinguish merchandise within a category as being on sale or
            being part of an associated promotion.</strong></p>

    <p>Following business rules, you can associate badges within products using backend factors. For example, any
        merchandising grid product presentation you can show: free shipping, on sale, and buy one get one free.</p>

    <h2 id="showing-discounts">15. Showing Discounts</h2>
    <p>The concept of “Was-Is Pricing” has always been an effective way to merchandise in an eCommerce store. By showing
        the old pricing, new pricing and the ultimate difference between the two, this additional layer of information
        is an effective way to persuade users and is worth testing in your store. This tactic is obviously more
        prominently used in discount environments and if your brand cycles inventory frequently.</p>

    <h2 id="email-me-my-cart">16. “Email Me My Cart” </h2>
    <p><strong>In today’s multi-device, multi-touch world, the need to bridge the gap between desktop and mobile
            sessions is paramount.</strong> Most brands do not have sophisticated data systems to enable the
        pre-population of cart contents across devices.</p>

    <p>A more simple approach is to allow your visitors to email their cart content to themselves. This approach allows
        your shoppers to quickly access their products on a desktop following a shopping session on mobile. Using
        tracking parameters, your business can also “stitch together” these sessions and enable more informed decisions
        relating to attribution and campaign spend performance.</p>

    <h2 id="delivery-and-ship-info">17. Delivery & Ship Info </h2>
    <p>Want a quick eCommerce improvement? Include delivery and shipping information on the product page. It works best
        if you enable users to input their zip codes (or conduct a geo lookup) and quickly deliver precise information
        (such as 2-4 days with standard shipping). This enhancement will serve your users well by answering a critical
        question in their minds (when will I get my stuff!).
    </p>
    <h2 id="product-page-qa">18. Product Page QA</h2>
    <p>Product page QA is a great addition to your webstore. Typically served via Javscript, this type of functionality
        allows your shoppers to ask specific questions on the page which then are stored and shown to future product
        viewers.</p>

    <p>Questions are routed to team members within your brand, and once answered are then published. Amazon takes this
        function a step further, facilitating consumers to answer questions about products. This type of functionality
        is vital within consumer electronics where specification questions and usage details are critical in educating a
        shopper when making a purchase decision.</p>

    <h2 id="related-searches">19. Related Searches</h2>
    <p>How smart is your on-site search? <strong>If you are not using algorithm-based semantic matching to help guide
            your shoppers, your site search is likely leaving dollars on the table.</strong></p>

    <p>Related searches driven by this type of technology will take previous searches from users as well as constructed
        searches that are pre-set and present these terms as filtering/refinement options when the shopper is in the
        discovery mindset.</p>

    <h2 id="caching">20. Caching</h2>
    <p><strong>A technical element of utmost importance, ensuring that your website supports browser caching is critical
            to maximizing your site performance.</strong></p>

    <p>There is a direct correlation between speed and conversion rates. After a shopper loads an element from your
        server, there is no need to serve it again when it can be cached locally. Ask your development team to ensure
        that your store leverages the latest in caching technology to present your best site speed to your shoppers.</p>

    <h2 id="prominent-pricing">21. Prominent Pricing</h2>
    <p><strong>In conducting hundreds of tests on product pages for brands of all sizes, one aspect we have found that
            can enhance the effectiveness of a product page is the presentation of price.</strong></p>

    <p>Your price should be clear, big, bold and near the call to action button – most likely the standard “add to cart”
        action. The biggest thing to look out for within your product page presentation is to ensure that the pricing is
        displayed above the fold, both within desktop and mobile environments.</p>

    <h2 id="out-of-stock-reminders">22. Out-of-Stock Reminders</h2>
    <p>Do you have a product that goes out of stock quickly? This is a good sign because your merchandise is in demand,
        but this delivers a terrible experience for your eCommerce shoppers.</p>

    <p>Instead of leaving your shoppers unfulfilled and missing out on lost revenue, use technology to construct a user
        email reminder that informs the user when the product inventory rises above a certain threshold or is back in
        stock.</p>

    <h2 id="video-analytics">23. Video Analytics</h2>
    <p><strong>Analytics tells you what is happening, but primary usability research tells you why it is
            happening.</strong> A great way to kickstart your eCommerce intelligence into your site's usability is to
        implement video analytics into your site.</p>

    <p>This will allow your business to watch sessions for certain scenarios within certain pages, and get real-life
        examples of how your site experience is performing. Take this intelligence and strategically plan how to improve
        your site through functionality enhancements or bug rectification to things you haven’t noticed lately.</p>

    <h2 id="optimize-category-layouts">24. Optimize Category Layouts</h2>
    <p>Category, sub-category and family pages are eCommerce templates with the core and only goal of product
        merchandising. <strong>These pages exist to present your catalog in dynamic ways, making it easy for users to
            analyze and evaluate product options within a given category.</strong></p>

    <p>Slight changes in how these pages are constructed and the overall design elements can equal large gains in
        “category to product page progression” ratios.</p>

    <p>Think outside the box in these templates. What can be added to better engage users, expand and deliver a more
        complete assortment, and enable the ability to quickly evaluate products? Use an optimization platform to
        conduct multivariate tests and assess how the changes affect key metrics.</p>

    <h2 id="unique-copy-at-product-level">25. Unique Copy at Product Level</h2>
    <p><strong>One of the most under-valued areas within an eCommerce operation is the importance of product
            copy.</strong> Brands and retailers frequently just utilize manufacturer content that is provided. This copy
        is typically “thin” and not written to engage shoppers and sell.</p>

    <p>By enhancing this copy with more descriptive text, product value (i.e. what problems are solved by the product)
        and by summarizing key points with bullets, your products will likely convert more effectively. It may seem
        mundane and not very sexy, but refreshing your copy will help SEO and conversion in parallel.</p>

    <h2 id="internatioinal-messaging">26. International Messaging</h2>
    <p>Do you ship internationally? If so, then be sure to make sure your non-US traffic knows!</p>

    <p>Create country banners that render above the header that are dynamically served when the website identifies an
        international visit. By informing the shopper that the website will indeed ship to their native country, your
        brand can capture this additional segment more effectively.</p>

    <h2 id="product-targeting">27. Product Targeting </h2>
    <p>Another tactic to more effectively convert shoppers is to target merchandising based on product views in a
        category. For example, if a shopper goes to WalMart.com and viewed 5 products within the Star Wars category,
        when the user comes back to the website on a subsequent visit or to the homepage, tailored creative will be
        shown to further spur a purchase of the product category that was viewed.</p>

    <p>In omni-channel scenarios, these scenarios can cross physical and digital lines – i.e. tailoring products and
        promotions based on in-store purchases. To achieve a result such as this, a data management platform is required
        to house all the attributes and data – while “listening” to all channels for when it can make a match and
        deliver on triggered marketing.</p>

    <h2 id="auto-suggestion-for-search">28. Auto Suggestion for Search</h2>
    <p>Site search, as mentioned earlier, is really critical to get right. <strong>One additional component to ensure
            your site maximizes search is auto suggestion.</strong> As a shopper utilizes your search function, the
        application presents suggestions for the user or provides quick jump points to related products based on the
        existing catalog feed within the store.</p>

    <h2 id="clear-error-messaging">29. Clear Error Messaging</h2>
    <p>Error messaging within your checkout process is an important component to not overlook. Most eCommerce platforms
        provide standard error messaging that is triggered when shoppers input wrong characters or similar. Sometimes
        though these errors are delivered on page load, causing abandoned checkout sessions.</p>

    <p><strong>It is crucial to ensure that his messaging loads instantly (not on page load) and uses a color and text
            scheme that quickly gets the shopper’s attention, allowing the user to make the needed changes to progress
            forward within the process.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="intelligent-emails">30. Intelligent Emails</h2>
    <p>No doubt, Email marketing has become more sophisticated within retailers and brands over the last 12-24 months.
        No longer is sending out blast promotions a strategy for growing loyalty and purchases from within your house
        list.</p>

    <p><strong>Using data management platforms, your business can create an ongoing record of activity, across all
            channels from your shoppers, and you can trigger email promotions queried from purchase and interactivity
            data.</strong></p>

    <p>For example, create an audience of all the shoppers who have bought a Philadelphia Eagles product over the last 2
        months and send a clearance email for Eagles merchandise. That is a powerful message targeting an appropriate
        audience for maximum impact.</p>

    <h2 id="product-videos">31. Product Videos</h2>
    <p>In reviewing product page data each day, we frequently see the impact that product video can have on the user
        experience. <strong>Already proven as one of the most effective advertising strategies within Facebook, using a
            short but descriptive video within the product page is a great way to further engagement and create a
            greater degree of interactivity.</strong></p>

    <p>Start on your top 100 products and see what type of impact video can drive on both page performance and overall
        conversion.</p>

    <h2 id="sales-section">32. Sales Section</h2>
    <p>Everyone likes a bargain and some shoppers are driven mainly by discounts and deals. These shopper subsets
        frequently show the propensity to click on “sale” or “clearance” sections within a website as a first navigation
        path.</p>

    <p>If your business is not luxury or brand-oriented, consider creating a category to house all of your out-of-life
        inventory to sell at cost or slightly above. Doing so will serve this subset of shoppers and enable your brand
        to have a future relationship, hopefully at full price.</p>

    <h2 id="live-chat-in-the-cart">33. Live Chat in the Cart</h2>
    <p>Where do shoppers have questions? While in the cart and checkout process of course. The “rubber meets the road”
        within these pages and your website needs to provide a quick pathway to service.</p>

    <p><strong>A quick solution outside of informational messaging is to provide a link to live chat within the
            cart/checkout.</strong> Upon initiation, the shopper is now able to ask complex questions to a live human
        and gain the confidence to move forward with the transaction.</p>
    <h2 id="persistent-cart">34. Persistent Cart</h2>
    <p>A persistent cart is when a visual cart icon and total are indicated in their website header after a cart action.
        This functionality provides shoppers with a quick path back to the transactional process and also gives details
        into order sub-totals.</p>

    <p>Making persistent carts become even more effective as dynamic messaging around order totals are provided, while
        informing shoppers how much merchandise is needed to receive incentives such as free shipping.</p>

    <h2 id="progress-indicators">35. Progress Indicators </h2>
    <p>As users flow through your checkout process, there is always a perception of “pain” as multiple pages and form
        fields present hurdles in ordering.</p>

    <p>Because of this, it’s absolutely vital to present exactly how many steps remain in an ordering process for
        complete alignment with your shopper to reduce abandonment. Make sure the indicator creative is in the primary
        visual viewing pane of the user, within the browser above the fold, and uses clear colors and/or contrast to
        distinguish among other checkout elements.</p>

    <h2 id="visual-credit-card-icons">36. Visual Credit Card Icons</h2>
    <p>A new tactic that many retailers are executing is to show a visual mock of a credit card along with logos to make
        entering numeric values more intuitive. Google frequently follows this approach within its products in order to
        reduce funnel leakage.</p>

    <h2 id="guest-checkout">37. Guest Checkout</h2>
    <p>Guest checkout is the process of allowing a prospective shopper to purchase from your store without having to
        register or create an account. <strong>In these instances, most brands will present the register option at the
            respective Thank You page, in conjunction with potentially firing off tracking pixels that have visibility
            into cross-channel behavior and mobile usage.</strong></p>

    <p>If your business is not giving your customers the ability to checkout as a guest, this is then the most impactful
        change you can likely make from this complete list.</p>

    <h2 id="maximize-the-thank-you-page">38. Maximize the Thank You Page</h2>
    <p><strong>Outside of getting a guest checkout shopper to register, the Thank You page is an effective method to
            further present offers and promotions that are relevant to the previous purchase.</strong> For example,
        after a shopper buys baby furniture, a brand could present a time-sensitive coupon for Free Shipping on all
        strollers.</p>

    <h2 id="facebook-remarketing">39. Facebook Remarketing </h2>
    <p>Sophisticated marketers are using pixel-created audiences to serve contextual ads that are targeted for greater
        effectiveness. This approach is allowing brands to spend their money more wisely and drive greater thresholds of
        return on ad spending.</p>

    <p>Facebook is the leader in this segment, enabling marketers to activate campaigns that enable brand engagement and
        present products within a re-engagement approach. Working effectively for smaller brands are pre-sale engagement
        pages that deliver content and videos in order to sell and engage traffic prior to presenting the ability to
        buy.</p>

    <h2 id="sticky-headers">40. Sticky Headers</h2>
    <p><strong>A new type of design approach that has gathered momentum within eCommerce, “sticky” headers keep website
            navigation in the primary visual pane of the user – therefore providing the shopper an easier path to either
            utilize site search or the website taxonomy.</strong></p>

    <p>This approach, which can be tested against your control header with optimization tools, can potentially increase
        your overall usage of your search box – which could drive greater levels of engagement and overall conversion.
    </p>

    <h2 id="security-assurance">41. Security Assurance</h2>
    <p>Even with the advances in web security, consumers are still scared of losing their credit card information by
        shopping on a second-rate website. With the data breaches that take place among the giant brands, consumers need
        reassurances that you are taking the appropriate safeguards.</p>

    <p>Outside of using HTTPS as a site protocol, be sure to message the shopping base how the website is kept safe to
        reduce fears.</p>

    <h2 id="mega-menus">42. Mega Menus</h2>
    <p>All too often, retailers render boring drop-down navigations that do nothing but present utility links for users
        to click through. <strong>Try optimizing your menu by using a mega menu that expands across the majority of your
            header presentation.</strong></p>

    <p>This extra real estate provides the ability to integrate promotions to a category, editor picks, as well as
        relevant content that supports the decision making process for the shopper.</p>

    <h2 id="timer-countdowns">43. Timer Countdowns</h2>
    <p>The old-fashioned timer presentation still works in delivering urgency and providing context to when a shopper
        has to make a decision.</p>

    <p>If you have sales or time-sensitive promotions, using this type of function within your homepage can be an
        effective tactic to drive higher conversion. These types of tools are made easier in macro-adopted platforms
        such as Shopify and/or Magento as pre-built extensions are integrated seamlessly and can be deployed rapidly.
    </p>

    <h2 id="gift-guides-and-lists">44. Gift Guides and Lists</h2>
    <p>Every brand needs to be a publisher and speak to an audience. How does your product solve a problem and/or
        enhance someone’s life? How can you educate your prospective customers about why you are better than the
        competition and how to choose from among your product mix?</p>

    <p><strong>Creative content in eCommerce is paramount, but two tactics seem to work better than others.</strong>
        Next peak season try creating gift guides for 5-10 different customer segments as well as construct editorial
        lists to help engage and educate (ex. The top 20 digital cameras this year).</p>
    <h2 id="bot-messengers">45. Bot Messengers</h2>
    <p>Lastly, every brand should be considering and planning a strategic bot strategy. Both within Facebook messenger
        and within a native website, shoppers are interacting with bots and having rewarding interactions.</p>

    <p>Your bot should not only engage in customer service-related tasks (ex. “Where is my order”) but should progress
        to become interactive sales assistants that ask questions within category presentations in order to suggest an
        effective product or lead a consumer to content.</p>
