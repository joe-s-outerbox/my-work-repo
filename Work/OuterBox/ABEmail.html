<h2>About</h2>
<p><strong>Phone Number Inclusion</strong></p>
<p>Trinity built out an A/B test within our partner’s automated email marketing journey with the goal of increasing call volume for a free consultation. The test included a unique phone number in the header to not only track clicks on the phone number, but also track all direct calls.</p>
<p>Following completion of the test, Trinity tracked results in Google Data Studio and calculated the revenue gains based on the phone call goal value.</p>
