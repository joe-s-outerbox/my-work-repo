        <h2 id="types-of-carry-on-bags" class="jump-target">Types of Carry-On Bags</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Understanding the different types of carry-on bags is essential.</strong> Whether you prefer suitcases, cabin bags, or duffel bags, each has unique benefits.
        </p>
        <h3>Suitcases</h3>
        <p>
            Suitcases are a classic choice among the various types of carry-on luggage, and we have options featuring hard or soft shells. They protect your belongings well, especially if you're carrying fragile items. Ours have sturdy wheels and telescopic handles, making them easy to navigate through busy airports. However, they can be a bit rigid when it comes to fitting them into overhead bins or squeezing through tight spaces on public transport.
        </p>
        <h3>Cabin Bags</h3>
        <p>
            Cabin bags have a soft, flexible structure that allows you to fit them into tighter spaces. Cabin bags typically have enough room for a few days' essentials, making them ideal for short trips. Our models, like the <a href="https://briggs-riley.co.uk/products/wheeled-cabin-bag">Rhapsody Wheeled Cabin Bag</a>, offer all the organisational features of more structured bags.
        </p>
        <h3>Duffel Bags</h3>
        <p>
            Duffel bags combine versatility with a casual style. Our <a href="https://briggs-riley.co.uk/products/garment-duffle">Baseline 56cm Garment Duffle</a> delivers the easy transport you want. Duffels are lightweight and expandable, accommodating various packing needs. However, they might not provide the same level of protection as a hard-shell suitcase.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing these options can help your search for the best carry-on luggage, allowing you to select one that matches your travel style and needs.
        </p>
        <h2 class="jump-target" id="what-to-look-for">What to Look For in the Best Carry-On Luggage</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Choosing the best hand luggage involves more than just picking the prettiest bag on display.</strong> Several factors come into play that can significantly affect your travel experience. The right hand luggage can make a world of difference, especially when navigating bustling airports or racing to catch a flight.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the weight of the bag itself. A lightweight carry-on allows you to pack more without exceeding airline weight limits. It also makes moving your bag around much easier, whether you're lifting it into an overhead compartment or carrying it on public transport.
        </p>
        <p>
            The material of the luggage is equally important. Hard-shell suitcases, like the <a href="https://briggs-riley.co.uk/products/essential-carry-on-expandable-spinner">Sympatico Essential 56cm Carry-On Expandable Spinner</a>, offer durability and protection against the elements, keeping your belongings safe from unexpected weather or rough handling. Made of tough ballistic nylon, soft-shell options, such as the <a href="https://briggs-riley.co.uk/products/domestic-carry-on-expandable-spinner">ZDX Domestic 56cm Carry-on Expandable Spinner</a>, provide flexibility and are less prone to scratches and dents.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don’t overlook the pockets and compartments, like those available with our <a href="https://briggs-riley.co.uk/products/wide-carry-on-wheeled-garment-spinner">Baseline 53cm Carry-On Wheeled Garment Spinner</a>. The best carry-on luggage has enough storage options to keep your items organised, making it easier to find your passport or headphones without turning your bag inside out. Having external pockets is a bonus for items you might need in a hurry.
        </p>
